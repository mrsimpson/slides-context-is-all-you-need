# The Mega-Prompt Approach
*"Put everything in the system prompt"*

<div class="mt-8">
<div class="i-uim-cube text-2xl text-blue-500 inline mr-2"></div> **Lego:** Comprehensive instruction manual for every build

<div class="mt-4">
<div class="i-uim-users-alt text-2xl text-green-500 inline mr-2"></div> **Parenting:** Detailed rules for every situation

<!--
The mega-prompt approach made perfect sense for early LLMs. Like giving a new Lego builder a comprehensive instruction manual, or writing detailed household rules for young children.

When LLMs needed explicit guidance for every scenario, packing everything into a massive system prompt - coding standards, architecture principles, deployment processes - was the logical solution.

**When it worked well:** Early LLMs that needed detailed instructions
**Current considerations:** Can cause information overload with mature LLMs, but still valuable for specific, well-defined scenarios
