# The Maturity Formula

<!--

**Technical Skills** + **Experience** = **Maturity**

**Maturity** + **Available Knowledge** = **Good Guessing**

**Speaker Notes:**

This visual equation laid out on the desk represents something fundamental about how intelligence develops - whether human or artificial.

Look at the progression: vintage tools representing technical skills, combined with old books representing experience, leads to that graduation cap - the symbol of maturity. But maturity alone isn't enough.

When you add that modern digital tablet - representing available knowledge, the right information at the right time - that's when you get the lightbulb moment. That's when good guessing becomes possible.

Think about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call "good guessing."

The same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.

This isn't magic. It's a predictable pattern of development that we can understand and work with.
