# Phase-Specific Context

<!--
📋 **Requirements Phase:** User stories, business context, constraints

🔧 **Development Phase:** Code files, architecture, patterns  

🐛 **Debugging Phase:** Error logs, stack traces, recent changes

Context Engineering isn't one-size-fits-all. Different phases of development require different types of context.

During requirements gathering, you need user stories, business context, and constraints. During development, you need relevant code files, architecture decisions, and established patterns. During debugging, you need error logs, stack traces, and information about recent changes.

The art is knowing what context matters most for each phase and providing just enough - not too little, not too much.
