# The Mega-Prompt Approach

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: The mega-prompt approach was simple to implement, but **low coherence**

- Comprehensive instructions
- Fast show cases
- Information overload wrt. inference

*Transition: As LLMs became more capable, we developed the agent approach.*

...

**Reader Notes:**

The mega-prompt approach made perfect sense for showing-off LLMs capabilities. 

Like giving a new Lego builder a comprehensive instruction manual, or writing detailed household rules for young children, when LLMs needed explicit guidance for every scenario, packing everything into a massive system prompt was the logical solution. However, this can cause information overload with today's mature LLMs, as it reduces *coherence* though it still has value for specific, well-defined scenarios.
