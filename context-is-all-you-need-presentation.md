## SLIDE 1: Title Slide

**On Screen:**
# Context is All You Need
*Why Context Engineering is the Key Skill for AI-Era Developers*

**Speaker Notes:**
Good morning! I'm here to talk about what I believe is the most important skill shift happening in software development right now. And it starts with a conversation I had with my daughter.

---

## SLIDE 2: The Lego Story

**On Screen:**
*"Programming used to be like professional Lego building - you place every piece yourself"*

*"Now I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot"*

**Speaker Notes:**
I used to tell my daughter that programming is like professional Lego building - only the cleanup is faster. You carefully place each piece, following your mental blueprint, building something complex from simple components.

But recently, I had to update that explanation. Now I tell her: "I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot." The transformation has been that dramatic.

**[Audience Engagement]** How many of you have tried to explain your job to your kids? *[Show of hands, brief interaction]*

But here's the thing...

## SLIDE 3: The Question

**On Screen:**
**How can LLMs be so good at guessing?**

**Speaker Notes:**
This raises a fundamental question that I keep coming back to: How can these LLMs be so incredibly good at guessing what we want?

The answer isn't magic. It follows a pattern we recognize from human development...

---

## SLIDE 4: The Maturity Formula

**On Screen:**
**Technical Skills + Experience = Maturity**

**Maturity + Available Knowledge = Good Guessing**

**Speaker Notes:**
Think about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call "good guessing."

The same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.

---

## SLIDE 5: When Things Mature

**On Screen:**
**What makes something "mature"?**
- A child? üßí‚Üíüßë
- An LLM? ü§ñ‚Üíü§ñ‚ú®
- Software? üíª‚Üíüíª‚ö°

*We don't always know when, but we know where it comes from...*

**Speaker Notes:**
What exactly makes something mature? When does a child become capable of handling complex decisions with just context and boundaries instead of step-by-step instructions? When does an LLM reach that same point?

We don't always recognize maturity when it happens, but we can trace where it comes from. And for LLMs, we know exactly where this capability originated...

---

## SLIDE 6: The Technical Foundation

**On Screen:**
**We know where LLM maturity comes from:**

*Transformers Architecture*
‚Üì
*"Attention is all you need"*
‚Üì
*Context matters*

**Speaker Notes:**
The maturity of modern LLMs comes from a specific architectural breakthrough: Transformers. The 2017 paper "Attention is all you need" wasn't just a catchy title - it was a fundamental insight.

The ability to direct attention means the ability to focus on relevant context. And when you can focus on the right context at the right time, you can make much better decisions.

This isn't just about LLMs getting bigger or having more parameters. It's about a fundamental capability that enables context-aware processing. The architecture that makes good guessing possible.

---

## SLIDE 7: The Current State & Opportunity

**On Screen:**
**LLMs have matured**
*Just like children, they're ready for more independence*

**The Opportunity:**
*Context-based collaboration instead of step-by-step instructions*

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's what I don't tell my daughter about this programming-as-parenting parallel - she's not quite ready for full independence with complex logical tasks yet. But LLMs? They've reached that level of maturity.

Just like more mature children can handle tasks more independently when given the right context and boundaries, these models are now ready for more sophisticated context handling rather than detailed step-by-step instructions.

The opportunity is enormous. We can move from micromanaging every step to providing the right context and letting them work intelligently within those boundaries.

But to understand why this shift matters so much, let's look at the approaches we've been using and how they evolved with different levels of LLM maturity...

---

## SLIDE 8: Evolution Section Introduction

**On Screen:**
**Different Approaches for Different Maturities**
*Each served its purpose at the right time*

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's look at how our approaches to working with LLMs have evolved. What's important to understand is that these weren't failures - they were appropriate responses to different levels of LLM maturity. Each approach served its purpose at the right time.

**[Audience Engagement]** How do you supply context to your LLM? *[We'll come back to this after we explore the approaches]*

---

## SLIDE 9: The Mega-Prompt Approach

**On Screen:**
**The Mega-Prompt Approach**
*"Put everything in the system prompt"*

üß± **Lego:** Comprehensive instruction manual for every build
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Parenting:** Detailed rules for every situation

**Speaker Notes:**
The mega-prompt approach made perfect sense for early LLMs. Like giving a new Lego builder a comprehensive instruction manual, or writing detailed household rules for young children.

When LLMs needed explicit guidance for every scenario, packing everything into a massive system prompt - coding standards, architecture principles, deployment processes - was the logical solution.

**When it worked well:** Early LLMs that needed detailed instructions
**Current considerations:** Can cause information overload with mature LLMs, but still valuable for specific, well-defined scenarios

---

## SLIDE 10: The Agent Approach

**On Screen:**
**The Agent Approach**
*"Specialized systems for specialized tasks"*

üß± **Lego:** Assembly line with specialized workers
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Parenting:** Structured activities with clear roles

**Speaker Notes:**
The agent approach emerged as a sophisticated solution - separate systems for different functions. One agent searches files, another analyzes dependencies, a third makes decisions about relevance.

Like an assembly line where each worker has a specific role, or structured family activities where everyone has clear responsibilities.

**When it works well:** Complex workflows, specialized tasks that benefit from dedicated focus
**Current considerations:** Can limit the natural flexibility of mature LLMs, but valuable for certain enterprise use cases

---

## SLIDE 11: The IDE Integration Approach

**On Screen:**
**The IDE Integration Approach**
*"Developer chooses the context"*

üß± **Lego:** Expert builder selecting their own pieces
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Parenting:** Collaborative decision-making with teenagers

**Speaker Notes:**
The IDE integration approach put control in the developer's hands. You select which files, which context, which information to share with the LLM.

Like an expert Lego builder choosing exactly which pieces they need, or collaborative decision-making where you involve your teenager in choosing what information they need.

**When it works well:** Developer-controlled scenarios, focused tasks with clear scope
**Current challenges:** Creates cognitive load on humans to assess context relevance, but still relevant for targeted work

---

## SLIDE 12: The Pattern

**On Screen:**
**Each Approach Matched Its Time**

Early LLMs ‚Üí Detailed Instructions
Capable LLMs ‚Üí Structured Workflows  
Mature LLMs ‚Üí **Context Collaboration**

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's the pattern: each approach matched the maturity level of the LLMs available at the time. Early LLMs needed detailed instructions. More capable LLMs could handle structured workflows. 

But now we have mature LLMs that are ready for something different: true context-based collaboration.

The question isn't which approach was right or wrong - it's recognizing when it's time to evolve to the next level.

---

## SLIDE 13: The Next Evolution

**On Screen:**
**Context Engineering**
*The natural progression for mature LLMs*

**Speaker Notes:**
So what's the next evolution? Context Engineering. This isn't about replacing the previous approaches - it's about recognizing that mature LLMs are ready for a fundamentally different kind of collaboration.

Just like we adjust our parenting style as children mature, we need to adjust how we work with LLMs as they become more capable.

---

## SLIDE 14: Tobi L√ºtke's Insight

**On Screen:**
*"I really like the term 'context engineering' over prompt engineering. It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM."*

**‚Äî Tobi L√ºtke, CEO Shopify**

**Speaker Notes:**
Tobi L√ºtke, the CEO of Shopify, captured this perfectly. Context Engineering isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental shift in perspective.

Prompt Engineering asks: "How should the LLM work?"
Context Engineering asks: "What information does it need?"

It's the difference between being a micromanager and being a good team leader. The micromanager explains every step. The good team leader ensures all relevant information is available and lets the team work.

---

## SLIDE 15: Context Engineering Defined

**On Screen:**
**Context Engineering:**
*Providing the right information at the right time*

üß± **Lego:** Right manual, pieces, and examples for THIS build
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Parenting:** Appropriate boundaries and context for THIS situation

**Speaker Notes:**
Context Engineering is the discipline of providing the right information at the right time. 

In Lego terms: instead of a generic instruction manual, you provide the specific manual, the right pieces, and relevant examples for THIS particular build.

In parenting terms: instead of universal rules, you provide appropriate boundaries and context for THIS specific situation, trusting their maturity to handle it well.

The key insight is specificity and trust in the system's capability to work intelligently within the provided context.

---

## SLIDE 16: The Breakthrough - Phase-Specific Context

**On Screen:**
**Different Phases Need Different Context**

üìã **Project Start:** Requirements, architecture, similar projects
üîß **Implementation:** Relevant code, patterns, APIs  
üêõ **Debugging:** Error logs, related code, recent changes

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's the breakthrough insight that changed everything for me: relevant context is heavily dependent on the current development phase.

When you're starting a project, you need requirements, architecture documentation, and examples of similar projects. Detailed code implementations are irrelevant and just add noise.

When you're implementing, you need the relevant code files, established patterns, and API documentation. High-level requirements documents become noise.

When you're debugging, you need error logs, the specific code involved, and recent changes. Everything else is distraction.

This phase-awareness is what makes Context Engineering so powerful - it's not just about having information, it's about having the RIGHT information for what you're trying to accomplish right now.

---

## SLIDE 17: Context Relevance Matrix

**On Screen:**
**Context Relevance by Phase**

| Information Type | Project Start | Implementation | Debugging |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Requirements     | ‚úÖ Critical   | ‚ùå Noise      | ‚ùå Noise  |
| Code Files       | ‚ùå Noise      | ‚úÖ Critical   | ‚úÖ Critical |
| Error Logs       | ‚ùå Noise      | ‚ùå Noise      | ‚úÖ Critical |
| Architecture     | ‚úÖ Critical   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes  | ‚ùå Noise  |

**Speaker Notes:**
This matrix illustrates the core principle. The same piece of information can be critical in one phase and pure noise in another.

Requirements are critical when starting a project but become noise when you're deep in debugging. Error logs are essential for debugging but irrelevant when you're planning architecture.

Traditional approaches either try to provide everything (information overload) or make humans decide what's relevant (cognitive overload). Context Engineering provides the right information for the current phase.

---

## SLIDE 18: Post-Agentistic Vision

**On Screen:**
**LLMs as Flexible Orchestrators**
*Not rigid agents, but intelligent collaborators*

**The Future:** LLMs choose their own tools and context

**Speaker Notes:**
This leads us to what I call a post-agentistic vision. Instead of rigid agent pipelines that constrain LLM flexibility, we let mature LLMs orchestrate their own tool usage.

Think about it: LLMs are getting better at using tools flexibly through standards like the Model Context Protocol. Why force them into rigid agent workflows when they can intelligently choose what they need?

It's like the difference between a strict assembly line and a skilled craftsperson who selects the right tools for each task. The craftsperson approach leverages the full capability of the mature system.

---

## SLIDE 19: Practical Implementation

**On Screen:**
**How Context Engineering Works in Practice**

1. **Phase Recognition:** System understands current development phase
2. **Context Selection:** Provides relevant information for that phase  
3. **Flexible Orchestration:** LLM chooses appropriate tools and approaches
4. **Natural Memory:** Context builds understanding over time

**Speaker Notes:**
In practice, Context Engineering works through four key elements:

First, the system recognizes what phase of development you're in - are you exploring, designing, implementing, or debugging?

Second, it provides the context that's relevant for that specific phase, filtering out the noise.

Third, it lets the LLM orchestrate flexibly - choosing the right tools and approaches for the task at hand.

Fourth, it builds natural memory over time, so context accumulates and understanding deepens throughout the project.

This isn't about replacing human judgment - it's about augmenting it with intelligent context management.

## SLIDE 20: Context Engineering is Engineering

**On Screen:**
**Context Engineering is Engineering**
*Different skills, same importance*

**Traditional Engineering:** Building systems that work
**Context Engineering:** Providing information that enables intelligence

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's the crucial point: Context Engineering is engineering. It's not a soft skill or a nice-to-have. It's a core engineering discipline that requires the same rigor and expertise as any other engineering practice.

Traditional engineering is about building systems that work reliably and efficiently. Context Engineering is about providing information that enables intelligent systems to work effectively.

Both require deep understanding, systematic thinking, and continuous refinement. Both are essential for success in their respective domains.

---

## SLIDE 21: The Skills Shift

**On Screen:**
**Engineers Must Evolve to Remain Relevant**

**New Core Skills:**
- Information architecture for AI systems
- Phase-aware context design  
- Intelligent tool orchestration
- Context quality assessment

**Speaker Notes:**
The message is clear: engineers must develop these new skills to remain relevant in the AI era. This isn't about replacing coding skills - it's about adding a new dimension to our expertise.

We need to become skilled at information architecture for AI systems, designing context that's aware of development phases, orchestrating intelligent tool usage, and assessing the quality of the context we provide.

These skills are as learnable and measurable as any other engineering discipline. The question is: will you develop them proactively, or will you be forced to catch up later?

---

## SLIDE 22: The Opportunity

**On Screen:**
**Those Who Master Context Engineering Will Thrive**

**The Advantage:**
- More effective AI collaboration
- Better project outcomes  
- Reduced cognitive load
- Competitive differentiation

**Speaker Notes:**
The opportunity for those who master Context Engineering is enormous. You'll collaborate more effectively with AI systems, achieve better project outcomes, reduce your own cognitive load, and create significant competitive differentiation.

While others are still micromanaging AI tools or struggling with information overload, you'll be working in true partnership with mature AI systems.

This isn't just about being more productive - it's about fundamentally changing how software gets built and how problems get solved.

## SLIDE 23: Your Next Steps

**On Screen:**
**Start Your Context Engineering Journey**

1. **Assess** your current context supply methods
2. **Experiment** with phase-aware context
3. **Build** tools that support context engineering
4. **Share** your learnings with the community

**Speaker Notes:**
So where do you start? First, honestly assess how you currently supply context to AI systems. Are you using mega-prompts? Agent workflows? Manual selection? Each has its place, but recognize the limitations.

Second, experiment with phase-aware context. Try providing different information based on what you're trying to accomplish. Notice the difference in AI responses.

Third, consider building or adopting tools that support context engineering principles. This might be as simple as better organization of your development context, or as sophisticated as systems that automatically provide phase-relevant information.

Finally, share your learnings. Context Engineering is still emerging as a discipline. Your experiments and insights contribute to the collective understanding.

## SLIDE 24: Final Thought

**On Screen:**
**"The future belongs not to those who prompt best, but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively"**

**Context is all you need.**

**Speaker Notes:**
I'll leave you with this thought: The future belongs not to those who craft the cleverest prompts, but to those who understand how to provide what LLMs need to work effectively.

Just like "Attention is all you need" unlocked the potential of Transformers, "Context is all you need" unlocks the potential of mature AI collaboration.

The tools are ready. The LLMs are mature. The question is: are you ready to engineer the context that will define the next era of software development?

Thank you. I'm happy to take your questions.
