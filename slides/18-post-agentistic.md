# Post-Agentistic AI

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Future involves flexible LLM orchestration rather than rigid agent constraints

- Flexible orchestration
- Tool selection
- Craftsperson approach

*Transition: But here's the crucial point about Context Engineering.*

...

**Reader Notes:**

This leads us to what I call a post-agentistic vision. Instead of rigid agent pipelines that constrain LLM flexibility, we let mature LLMs orchestrate their own tool usage. Think about it: LLMs are getting better at using tools flexibly through standards like the Model Context Protocol. Why force them into rigid agent workflows when they can intelligently choose what they need? It's like the difference between a strict assembly line and a skilled craftsperson who selects the right tools for each task.
