# Questions & Discussion

<!--

❓

*Individual developer strengths and Context Engineering adaptations*

**Speaker Notes:**

I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions about Context Engineering. 

Some areas we might explore:
- How does this apply to your current development workflow?
- What challenges do you see in implementing context engineering practices?
- How might different developer strengths (frontend, backend, DevOps, etc.) adapt to context engineering differently?
- What tools or practices are you already using that align with these concepts?

The floor is yours for questions and discussion.
