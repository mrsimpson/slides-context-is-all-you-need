Context Engineering is the discipline of providing the right information at the right time. 

In Lego terms: instead of a generic instruction manual, you provide the specific manual, the right pieces, and relevant examples for THIS particular build. 

In parenting terms: instead of universal rules, you provide appropriate boundaries and context for THIS specific situation, trusting their maturity to handle it well. The key insight is specificity and trust in the system's capability to work intelligently within the provided context.
