# LLMs have matured

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: LLMs have reached sufficient maturity for independent operation with context-based collaboration

- Maturity achieved
- Independence ready
- Collaboration opportunity

*Transition: To understand why this shift matters, let's look at how our approaches have evolved.*

...

Here's what I don't tell my daughter about this programming-as-parenting parallel - she's not quite ready for full independence with complex logical tasks yet. But LLMs? They've reached that level of maturity. Just like mature children can handle tasks independently when given the right context and boundaries, these models are now ready for sophisticated context handling rather than detailed step-by-step instructions. The opportunity is enormous - we can move from micromanaging every step to providing the right context and letting them work intelligently within those boundaries.
