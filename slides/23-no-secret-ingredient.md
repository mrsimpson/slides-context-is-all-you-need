Just like Po discovered with his father's noodle soup, there is no secret ingredient to effective LLM inference. No magic prompts, no hidden techniques, no special sauce. The power has always been in something much simpler and more fundamental: context. When you provide the right context - the right information at the right time in the right format - LLMs work beautifully. When you don't, they struggle. It's not about finding the secret; it's about mastering the fundamentals. Context is all you need.
