# Development Plan: context-is-all-you-need (default branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-08 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: slides*

## Goal
Create engaging slides based on the blog post "Context is all you need" - transforming the written content into a compelling presentation format that effectively communicates the key concepts of Context Engineering vs Prompt Engineering

## Ideate
### Tasks
- [x] Analyze the blog post structure and identify key themes
- [x] Define target audience and their technical background
- [x] Establish presentation goals and success criteria
- [x] Determine presentation format and duration constraints
- [x] Identify the core narrative arc and key takeaways
- [x] Research visual metaphors and examples to support concepts
- [x] Define scope: what to include vs. exclude from the blog content

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Read and analyzed the source blog post content
- [x] Defined target audience (developers, dev managers, AI enthusiasts - conference setting)
- [x] Established primary goal (Context Engineering as engineering skill)
- [x] Set presentation duration (30min + Q&A)
- [x] Defined structural approach (problem → historic solutions → solution)
- [x] Refined engagement approach (questions about shared experiences)
- [x] Set technical depth (no code, maybe diagrams, minimal MCP details)
- [x] Scoped content (save individual strengths for Q&A)
- [x] Evolved to dual metaphor: Lego (for developers) + Parenting/Household (for managers)
- [x] Added maturity insight: Children/LLMs need maturity for context-based approaches to work
- [x] Refined opening story structure: Lego explanation to daughter, then private parenting reflection

## Structure

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] The presentation concept and key messages have been clearly defined
- [x] Target audience and their knowledge level have been identified

- [x] Core content from the blog post has been analyzed and understood
- [x] Scope and time constraints have been defined

### Tasks
- [x] Create detailed presentation outline with main sections
- [x] Define slide sequence and narrative progression
- [x] Plan smooth transitions between topics using metaphors
- [x] Estimate timing for each section (30min total)
- [x] Identify audience engagement points and questions
- [x] Plan visual flow and diagram requirements
- [x] Map blog content to presentation structure
- [x] Define key examples and supporting materials needed

### Completed
- [x] Created detailed presentation outline with main sections
- [x] Refined opening sequence (swapped Secret and Question)
- [x] Enhanced Evolution section with Transformers architecture explanation
- [x] Planned visual flow: Lego building progression, parenting scenarios, technical diagrams
- [x] Mapped blog content to presentation sections
- [x] Identified key examples: Tobi Lütke quote, phase-specific context scenarios, MCP mention

## Draft

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Detailed presentation outline with main sections has been created
- [x] Slide sequence and narrative flow have been defined
- [x] Transitions between topics have been planned
- [x] Timing for each section has been estimated
- [x] Key examples and supporting materials have been identified

### Tasks
- [x] Write presentation content for each slide/section
- [x] Create comprehensive speaker notes as main deliverable
- [x] Define visual vs. spoken content split for each slide
- [x] Identify concepts requiring visualization
- [x] Create specifications for visual content
- [x] Develop opening story with both metaphors
- [x] Write transitions between sections
- [x] Create audience engagement questions

### Completed
- [x] Started drafting slide content and speaker notes
- [x] Refined opening sequence to separate daughter story from maturity concept
- [x] Restructured slide 3 flow: guessing → knowledge → maturity
- [x] Fixed audience engagement placement (moved to slide 2)
- [x] Corrected maturity formula: Technical skills + Experience = Maturity; Maturity + Available knowledge = Good guessing
- [x] Continued with slides 5-6 covering technical foundation
- [x] Moved daughter/parenting reference to slide 7 with positive framing
- [x] Drafted Evolution section with three approaches
- [x] Refined audience engagement question to focus on context supply methods
- [x] Drafted Context Engineering solution section
- [x] Completed call-to-action section

## Style

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Presentation content for each slide/section has been written

## Key Decisions
- **Target Audience**: Developers and ex-developers-now-managers, plus AI/software development enthusiasts (conference setting)
- **Primary Goal**: Make people aware that Context Engineering is engineering requiring different skills than coding
- **Secondary Goal**: Position engineers to sharpen their tools to remain relevant (including responsible-vibe-mcp)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes + Q&A
- **Structure Approach**: Problem-focused introduction → Historic solutions → The solution (Context Engineering as engineering skill)
- **IMPORTANT REFINEMENT**: Previous approaches didn't "fail" - they were appropriate for different LLM maturity levels and still have valid use cases

## Notes
**Core Insight**: Context Engineering is engineering - requires different skills than coding, but engineers must develop these skills to remain relevant

**Metaphor Strategy**: 
- Lego building (for developers): From manual building → instructing robot → providing context to robot
- Parenting (for managers): From doing everything → micromanaging → setting boundaries and context
- Maturity theme: Both children and LLMs needed maturity for context-based approaches to work

**Opening Hook**: Personal story with public narrative (Lego explanation to daughter) and private reflection (parenting metaphor she's not ready for)

**Key Message**: We're treating mature LLMs like toddlers when they're ready for context-based collaboration
