**Reader Notes:**

I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions about Context Engineering. We can explore how this applies to your current development workflow, what challenges you see in implementing these practices, how different developer strengths might adapt to context engineering differently, and what tools or practices you're already using that align with these concepts. The floor is yours for questions and discussion.
