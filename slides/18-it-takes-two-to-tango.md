# It Takes Two to Tango

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Effective AI collaboration requires clear human thinking - if you can't think clearly, your AI can't either

- Two to tango
- Human clarity
- Clear guidance

*Transition: This brings us to the practical implementation.*

...

Here's the breakthrough insight from building context engineering tools: It takes two to tango. We've been obsessing over AI capabilities - better models, smarter agents, more sophisticated prompting techniques. But we've missed the fundamental truth: *Only* if your context holds all the necessary information your agent needs at this moment, modern model inference is possible â€“ at an incredible quality. The real question isn't "How do we make AI smarter?" It's "Are you able to provide clear guidance?" Because if you can't think clearly, your AI can't either. Context engineering starts with us getting our minds clear first.
