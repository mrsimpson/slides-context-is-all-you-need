# The Agent Approach

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Agent approach provides sophisticated specialization but can constrain mature LLM flexibility

- Specialized systems
- Assembly line
- Flexibility limits

*Transition: Then came IDE integration, putting control in developers' hands.*

...

**Reader Notes:**

The agent approach emerged as a sophisticated solution - separate systems for different functions. One agent searches files, another analyzes dependencies, a third makes decisions about relevance. Like an assembly line where each worker has a specific role, or structured family activities where everyone has clear responsibilities. While this works well for complex workflows and specialized tasks, it can limit the natural flexibility of mature LLMs, though it remains valuable for certain enterprise use cases.
