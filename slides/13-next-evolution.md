- Mature LLMs
- Collaboration shift

*Transition: But what exactly is Context Engineering?*

...

**Reader Notes:**

So what's the next evolution? Context Engineering. This isn't about replacing the previous approaches - it's about recognizing that mature LLMs are ready for a fundamentally different kind of collaboration. Just like we adjust our parenting style as children mature, we need to adjust how we work with LLMs as they become more capable. This represents a stage separation moment where we move beyond complex agent orchestration to intelligent context-based collaboration.
