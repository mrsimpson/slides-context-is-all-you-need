# LLMs have matured
*Just like children, they're ready for more independence*

**Child â†’ Adult:** ğŸ‘¶ â†’ ğŸ‘¤

**LLM â†’ Intelligent:** <uim-android class="inline text-4xl text-green-500"/> â†’ ğŸ§ 

## The Opportunity:
*Context-based collaboration instead of step-by-step instructions*

<!--
Here's what I don't tell my daughter about this programming-as-parenting parallel - she's not quite ready for full independence with complex logical tasks yet. But LLMs? They've reached that level of maturity.

Just like more mature children can handle tasks more independently when given the right context and boundaries, these models are now ready for more sophisticated context handling rather than detailed step-by-step instructions.

The opportunity is enormous. We can move from micromanaging every step to providing the right context and letting them work intelligently within those boundaries.

But to understand why this shift matters so much, let's look at the approaches we've been using and how they evolved with different levels of LLM maturity...
