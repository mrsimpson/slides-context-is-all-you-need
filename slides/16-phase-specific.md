# Phase-Specific Context

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Context relevance depends heavily on the current development phase

- Phase dependency
- Right information
- Context awareness

*Transition: Let me show you what this looks like in practice.*

...

Here's the breakthrough insight that changed everything for me: relevant context is heavily dependent on the current development phase. During requirements gathering, you need user stories, business context, and constraints. During development, you need relevant code files, architecture decisions, and established patterns. During debugging, you need error logs, stack traces, and information about recent changes. The art is knowing what context matters most for each phase and providing just enough - not too little, not too much.
