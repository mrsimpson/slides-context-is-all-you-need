*Generated on 2025-09-05 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [slides](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/slides)*

## Goal
Enhance the existing "post-agentic" section of the slides with new insights from workflows tool development, focusing on the "it takes two to tango" principle and three layers of context engineering.

## Ideate
### Tasks
- [x] Review current slide content and identify areas for improvement
- [x] Analyze new insights from workflows tool development
- [x] Define key messages to incorporate: "it takes two to tango", three layers of context engineering
- [x] Identify which slides need updates vs. new slides needed
- [x] Clarify target audience and presentation context
- [x] Map specific enhancement strategy for post-agentic section

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Reviewed existing slides structure (26 slides total, covers evolution from mega-prompts to context engineering)
- [x] Confirmed target audience: developers already engaged in AI-assisted development
- [x] Identified focus shift: emphasize new insights over basics
- [x] Refined approach: enhance existing post-agentic section (slides 18-21)
- [x] **Enhancement Plan**:
  - Slide 18: "It Takes Two to Tango" (replace post-agentistic concept)
  - Slide 19: Three Layers framework (replace practical implementation)
  - Slide 20: Keep "Context is Engineering" 
  - Slide 21: Update skills to "Clear Thinking → Good Context → Good AI Inference + Documentation"

### Completed
- [x] **Slide 18 Structure**: "It Takes Two to Tango"
  - **Title**: "It Takes Two to Tango"
  - **Core Message**: Developers must think clearly first before AI can be effective
  - **Key Points**:
    - "If your context holds all necessary information, modern AI inference is incredible"
    - "But here's the real question: Are you able to provide clear guidance?"
    - "If you can't think clearly, your AI can't either"
  - **Transition from 17**: Phase-aware context (matrix) → Human clarity requirement
  - **Visual**: Two dancers or partnership imagery

- [x] **Slide 19 Structure**: "Three Layers of Context Engineering"
  - **Title**: "Three Layers of Context Engineering"
  - **Core Message**: Practical framework for providing clear context
  - **Key Points**:
    - **Layer 1**: Rich Conversation Context (systematic thinking)
    - **Layer 2**: Process Memory (phase-aware development plans)
    - **Layer 3**: Long-term Memory (requirements, architecture, design docs)
  - **Transition from 18**: Human clarity → Practical framework
- [x] **Slide 21 Structure**: "New Skills Framework"
  - **Title**: "Engineers Must Evolve to Remain Relevant"
  - **Core Message**: Clear Thinking → Good Context → Good AI Inference + Documentation
  - **Key Points**:
    - **Clear Thinking**: Systematic problem analysis and requirement clarity
    - **Good Context**: Three-layer context engineering implementation
    - **Good AI Inference**: AI becomes capable execution partner
    - **+ Documentation**: Long-term memory for sustained collaboration
  - **Transition from 20**: Context as engineering discipline → Required skills
  - **Visual**: Four-tile layout showing the progression

- [x] **Transition Flow**: 17→18→19→20→21→22
  - **17→18**: Phase-aware context matrix → Human clarity requirement
  - **18→19**: "It takes two to tango" → Practical framework (three layers)
  - **19→20**: Three layers framework → Context as engineering discipline
  - **20→21**: Engineering discipline → Required skills for developers
  - **21→22**: New skills → The opportunity ahead

- [x] **Examples/Demonstrations**:
  - Slide 18: workflows tool development experience as proof point
  - Slide 19: Concrete examples for each layer (conversation, process, long-term)
  - Slide 21: Before/after scenarios showing skill application

- [x] **Timing Impact**: +2-3 minutes for enhanced content depth, maintains overall flow

## Key Decisions
- **Target Audience**: Developers already using AI-assisted development (advanced deck)
- **Content Strategy**: Create separate advanced deck, preserve original for beginners
- **New Deck Focus**: Breakthrough insights over foundational concepts
- **Core New Messages**:
  1. "It takes two to tango" - developers must think clearly first
  2. Three layers of context engineering framework
  3. Root cause analysis: human overwhelm, not just AI limitations
  4. Clear thinking → Good context → Good AI inference progression

## Notes
**Current Slide Analysis:**
- Slides 1-8: Setup and evolution story (may need condensing)
- Slides 9-14: Technical progression (good foundation)
- Slides 15-17: Context definition (needs enhancement with new insights)
- Slides 18-22: Skills and implementation (prime area for new content)
- Slides 23-26: Conclusion and next steps

**Key Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Replace basic explanations with deeper insights about WHY context engineering fails
- Add concrete framework (three layers) where current slides are abstract
- Strengthen the human responsibility angle ("it takes two to tango")
- Include practical implementation based on workflows tool experience
