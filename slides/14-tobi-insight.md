**Reader Notes:**

Tobi Lütke, CEO of Shopify, captured this perfectly. Context Engineering isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental shift in perspective. Prompt Engineering asks "How should the LLM work?" while Context Engineering asks "What information does it need?" It's the difference between being a micromanager who explains every step and being a good team leader who ensures all relevant information is available and lets the team work.
