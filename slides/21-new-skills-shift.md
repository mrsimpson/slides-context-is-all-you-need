<!--
**Speaker Notes:**

This is the skills evolution that developers need to master. It's not about replacing coding skills - it's about adding a new dimension to our expertise.

**Clear Thinking**: The foundation skill. Systematic problem analysis, requirement clarity, organized approach to complex engineering challenges. If you can't think clearly about a problem, no amount of AI sophistication will help you solve it effectively.

**Good Context**: The three-layer framework we just discussed. Rich conversation context, process memory, and long-term documentation. This is the practical implementation of clear thinking - how you structure and provide the information AI needs.

**Good AI Inference**: When you provide clear context through these layers, AI transforms from a chaotic assistant that generates more problems than it solves, into a capable execution partner that can handle implementation work while you focus on engineering decisions.

**Update Documentation**: The multiplier effect. Good documentation creates long-term memory that enables sustained collaboration across sessions and projects. You build on previous work instead of starting from scratch every time, so you need to make sure it's up-to-date!

The progression is crucial: Clear Thinking enables Good Context, which enables Good AI Inference, amplified by Documentation for long-term effectiveness.

These skills are as learnable and measurable as any other engineering discipline. The question is: will you develop them proactively, or will you be forced to catch up later when your current approach hits its limits?
