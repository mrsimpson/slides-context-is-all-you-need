**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: LLM maturity traces to Transformers architecture and attention mechanisms enabling context-aware processing

- Transformers breakthrough
- Attention mechanism
- Knowledge and relations as result of training, but inference needs **relevant** context!

*Transition: And transformers has evolved, having reached a new level of maturity*

...

**Reader Notes:**

The maturity of modern LLMs comes from a specific architectural breakthrough: Transformers. The 2017 paper "Attention is all you need" wasn't just a catchy title - it was a fundamental insight. The ability to direct attention means the ability to focus on relevant context. When you can focus on the right context at the right time, you can make much better decisions. This isn't just about LLMs getting bigger - it's about a fundamental capability that enables context-aware processing, the architecture that makes good guessing possible.
