Icon placeholders used:
- 🔧 for wrench/tools (generate: simple line art wrench icon, monochrome)
- 🎓 for graduation cap (generate: simple graduation cap icon, academic style)
- 💾 for database/storage (generate: simple database cylinder icon, tech style)
- uim-check-circle for target/success (available icon)

Think about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call "good guessing."

The same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.
