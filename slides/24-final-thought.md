# Context is All You Need

*The future belongs not to those who code best not to those who prompt best <br/>â€“ but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively*

<!--
**The tools are ready. The LLMs are mature. Are you ready to engineer the context?**

I'll leave you with this thought: The future belongs not to those who craft the cleverest prompts, but to those who understand how to provide what LLMs need to work effectively.

Just like "Attention is all you need" unlocked the potential of Transformers, "Context is all you need" unlocks the potential of mature AI collaboration.

Context is all you need - but only when you're working with mature intelligence. Early LLMs needed detailed instructions. Current LLMs need thoughtful context. Future LLMs will need even more sophisticated context engineering.

The developers who master this skill - who understand how to provide the right information at the right time, who can engineer context rather than engineer prompts - they're the ones who will thrive in the AI-augmented future.

The tools are ready. The LLMs are mature. The question is: are you ready to engineer the context that will define the next era of software development?

Thank you. I'm happy to take your questions.
