# Context is All You Need
*Why Context Engineering is the Key Skill for AI-Era Developers*

Welcome everyone. I'm here to talk about what I believe is the most important skill for developers in the AI era - and it's not what you might expect.

The title "Context is All You Need" is a deliberate nod to the famous 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" that gave us the transformer architecture. Just as attention mechanisms unlocked the potential of modern AI, I believe context engineering will unlock the potential of human-AI collaboration.

Today I want to share with you why this shift matters, how we got here, and most importantly, what it means for your daily work as developers.

Let me start with a story about explaining programming to my daughter...
