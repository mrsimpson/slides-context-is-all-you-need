"I really like the term 'context engineering' over prompt engineering. It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM."

<!--
Tobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, captured this perfectly. Context Engineering isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental shift in perspective.

Prompt Engineering asks: "How should the LLM work?"
Context Engineering asks: "What information does it need?"

It's the difference between being a micromanager and being a good team leader. The micromanager explains every step. The good team leader ensures all relevant information is available and lets the team work.
