# Evolution

<!--
Here's the pattern that emerges when you look at these three approaches together. It's not random - it follows the same developmental pattern we see in human growth.

👶 Early LLMs → 📄 Detailed Instructions

Early LLMs, like young children, needed detailed step-by-step instructions for everything. The mega-prompt approach was perfect for this stage.

🧒 Capable LLMs → 🗺️ Structured Workflows  

Capable LLMs, like older children, could handle more complex tasks but still needed structure and clear workflows. The agent approach served this need well.

👤 Mature LLMs → 💾 **Context Collaboration**

Mature LLMs, like responsible adults, can work intelligently within provided context without needing every step spelled out. This is where Context Engineering becomes the natural next evolution.

The key insight is that we're not abandoning the previous approaches - we're recognizing when each one is most appropriate based on the maturity level we're working with.
