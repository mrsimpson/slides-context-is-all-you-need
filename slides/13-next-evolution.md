# The Next Evolution

**Context Engineering**

*The natural progression for mature LLMs*

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**

This rocket launch perfectly represents where we're heading - the next phase of our evolution in working with AI systems.

Just like a rocket has multiple stages, each designed for a specific phase of the journey, our approaches to AI have evolved through distinct phases. We've had the mega-prompt stage, the agent workflow stage, and now we're launching into something entirely new.

Context Engineering represents this next stage - where we move beyond managing agents and workflows to enabling true intelligent collaboration. It's not about controlling every step or orchestrating complex agent interactions. It's about providing the right context and trusting the system's maturity to work intelligently within those boundaries.

So what's the next evolution? Context Engineering. This isn't about replacing the previous approaches - it's about recognizing that mature LLMs are ready for a fundamentally different kind of collaboration.

Just like we adjust our parenting style as children mature, we need to adjust how we work with LLMs as they become more capable.

This is the stage separation moment - where we leave behind the complexity of the previous approaches and enter a new phase of simplicity and effectiveness.
