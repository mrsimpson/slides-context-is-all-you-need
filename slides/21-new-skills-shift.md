**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Engineers must develop a new skill progression - clear thinking leads to good context which enables effective AI collaboration

- New and old skills
- Discipline
- "information developer"

*Transition: But here's what I want you to remember about all of this.*

...

**Reader Notes:**

This is the skills evolution that developers need to master. It's not about replacing coding skills - it's about adding a new dimension to our expertise. Clear Thinking is the foundation - systematic problem analysis, requirement clarity, organized approach to complex challenges. 

Good Context is the practical implementation through the three-layer framework we discussed. Good AI Inference happens when you provide clear context - AI transforms from chaotic assistant into capable execution partner. 

Living Documentation as a major pillar of long-term knowledge creates the multiplier effect, enabling sustained collaboration across sessions and projects. 

The progression is crucial: Clear Thinking enables Good Context, which enables Good AI Inference, amplified by Documentation for long-term effectiveness.
