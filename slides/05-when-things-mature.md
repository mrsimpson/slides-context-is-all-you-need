# What makes something "mature"?


<!--
*We don't always know when, but we know where it comes from...*

This image shows three parallel timelines of maturation, and it's fascinating how similar the patterns are.

Look at the child's journey - from needing step-by-step instructions for everything to being able to handle complex situations with just context and boundaries. The transition isn't always obvious when it happens, but we can see the progression.

The computer evolution shows the same pattern - from early systems that needed explicit programming for every scenario to modern AI that can interpret intent and work intelligently within provided context.

And software development follows the same arc - from simple programs that did exactly what they were told to sophisticated systems that can adapt and respond intelligently.

What exactly makes something mature? When does a child become capable of handling complex decisions with just context and boundaries instead of step-by-step instructions? When does an LLM reach that same point?

We don't always recognize maturity when it happens, but we can trace where it comes from. And for LLMs, we know exactly where this capability originated...
