# The Mega-Prompt Approach

<!--
*"Put everything in the system prompt"*

**Lego:** Comprehensive instruction manual for every build

**Parenting:** Detailed rules for every situation

The mega-prompt approach made perfect sense for early LLMs. Like giving a new Lego builder a comprehensive instruction manual, or writing detailed household rules for young children.

When LLMs needed explicit guidance for every scenario, packing everything into a massive system prompt - coding standards, architecture principles, deployment processes - was the logical solution.

**When it worked well:** Early LLMs that needed detailed instructions
**Current considerations:** Can cause information overload with mature LLMs, but still valuable for specific, well-defined scenarios
