# Next Steps

<!--
ðŸ“Š **Audit your current context practices**

ðŸ§ª **Experiment with phase-specific context**

ðŸ”§ **Build context engineering tools**

ðŸ“¤ **Share learnings with the community**

Here are concrete steps you can take to start developing your context engineering skills:

**Audit your current context practices:** Look at how you currently provide context to AI systems. What works? What doesn't? Where are the gaps?

**Experiment with phase-specific context:** Try providing different types of context for different development phases. Measure the results.

**Build context engineering tools:** Create systems and processes that make it easier to discover, filter, and deliver relevant context.

**Share learnings with the community:** Context engineering is still an emerging field. Your experiments and insights can help advance the entire discipline.
