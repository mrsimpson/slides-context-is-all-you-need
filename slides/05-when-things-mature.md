# What makes something "mature"?

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Maturity transitions can be subtle but their sources are traceable, leading to LLM capabilities

- Have seen many things
- Know relations
- Make use of tools

*Transition: For LLMs, we know exactly where this capability originated.*

...

What exactly makes something mature? Maturity comes from having seen many things, knowing the relations between them, and being able to make use of tools effectively. When does a child become capable of handling complex decisions with just context and boundaries instead of step-by-step instructions? When does an LLM reach that same point? We don't always recognize maturity when it happens, but we can trace where it comes from. For LLMs, we know exactly where this capability originated - and understanding this source is crucial for working effectively with mature AI systems.
