...

**Reader Notes:**

Here's the crucial point: Context Engineering is engineering. It's not a soft skill or a nice-to-have. It's a core engineering discipline that requires the same rigor, creativity and expertise as any other engineering practice. Traditional engineering is about building systems that work reliably and efficiently. Context Engineering is about providing information that enables intelligent systems to work effectively.
