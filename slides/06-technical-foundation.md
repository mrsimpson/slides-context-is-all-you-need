**We know where LLM maturity comes from:**

**Transformers Architecture** → **"Attention is all you need"** → **Context matters**

Here's the foundational paper that changed everything - "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani and colleagues from 2017. This isn't just academic history; this is the technical foundation that makes Context Engineering possible.

The maturity of modern LLMs comes from this specific architectural breakthrough. The 2017 paper wasn't just a catchy title - it was a fundamental insight about how intelligence can work.

Look at this paper - it introduced the concept that you don't need complex recurrent or convolutional networks. You just need attention mechanisms that can focus on the relevant parts of the input context.

The ability to direct attention means the ability to focus on relevant context. And when you can focus on the right context at the right time, you can make much better decisions. This is the technical foundation of what we now call "good guessing."

This isn't just about LLMs getting bigger or having more parameters. It's about a fundamental capability that enables context-aware processing. The architecture that makes intelligent context interpretation possible.

The transformer architecture gave LLMs the ability to understand which parts of the context matter most for any given task. That's what transformed them from simple pattern matching to intelligent reasoning systems.

This technical foundation is why we can now move beyond detailed prompting to sophisticated Context Engineering.
