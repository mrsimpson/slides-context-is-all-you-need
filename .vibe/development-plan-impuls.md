## Key Decisions
- Target audience: Strategic leaders (less technical detail needed)
- Duration: 15 minutes (15 slides at ~1 min/slide)
- Modular approach: Reuse existing slides where possible, create -strategical versions only when needed
- Content removed: Phase-specific technical details (slides 16-17), technical implementation slides (9-11, 17-19)
- Focus: High-level concepts, business value, strategic implications
- Created slides-strategical.md as main presentation file
- Created slides/21-skills-shift-strategical.md for strategic-focused skills discussion
- Terminology: Changed from "manager" to "strategical" throughout
