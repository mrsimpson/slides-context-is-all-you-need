# Post-Agentistic AI

<!--
*Beyond agents to intelligent collaboration*

This represents the future I think we're moving toward - post-agentistic AI. Instead of orchestrating multiple specialized agents, we work with mature AI systems that can intelligently navigate complex contexts.

The rocket launching represents this leap from the complexity of agent management to the simplicity of context-based collaboration.

It's not about eliminating agents entirely, but about recognizing when mature AI can work more effectively with rich context than with rigid workflows.
