<!--
What exactly makes something mature? When does a child become capable of handling complex decisions with just context and boundaries instead of step-by-step instructions? When does an LLM reach that same point?

We don't always recognize maturity when it happens, but we can trace where it comes from. And for LLMs, we know exactly where this capability originated...
