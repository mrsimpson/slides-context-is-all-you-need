# It Takes Two to Tango

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**

Here's the breakthrough insight from building context engineering tools: It takes two to tango.

We've been obsessing over AI capabilities - better models, smarter agents, more sophisticated prompting techniques. But we've missed the fundamental truth: if your context holds all the necessary information your agent needs at this moment, modern model inference is incredible.

The real question isn't "How do we make AI smarter?" It's "Are you able to provide clear guidance?"

Because here's what I learned building workflows: If you can't think clearly, your AI can't either.

This isn't about the AI being limited. It's about us as developers not establishing the clarity needed for effective collaboration. When we're overwhelmed, when our thinking is scattered, when we can't articulate what we need - that's when AI becomes a chaotic assistant instead of a capable partner.

The root cause of most AI collaboration failures isn't the technology. It's human overwhelm. We've lost the discipline of clear thinking in engineering, and without that foundation, no amount of AI sophistication will help.

Context engineering starts with us getting our minds clear first. Only then can we provide the context AI needs to be truly effective.
