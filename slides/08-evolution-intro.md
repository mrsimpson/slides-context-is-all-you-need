# Adequate context by Maturity Level

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Different LLM interaction approaches matched their respective maturity levels appropriately

- Evolutionary approaches
- Maturity matching
- Historical context

*Transition: Let's start with the mega-prompt approach.*

...

Let's look at how our approaches to working with LLMs have evolved. What's important to understand is that these weren't failures - they were appropriate responses to different levels of LLM maturity. Each approach served its purpose at the right time. How do you currently supply context to your LLM? We'll explore the evolution of these approaches and see where we're heading next.
