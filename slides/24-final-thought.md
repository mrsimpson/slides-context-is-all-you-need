*"The future belongs not to those who prompt best, but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively"*

<div class="text-4xl font-bold mt-12 text-blue-600">
Context is all you need.

<!--
I'll leave you with this thought: The future belongs not to those who craft the cleverest prompts, but to those who understand how to provide what LLMs need to work effectively.

Just like "Attention is all you need" unlocked the potential of Transformers, "Context is all you need" unlocks the potential of mature AI collaboration.

The tools are ready. The LLMs are mature. The question is: are you ready to engineer the context that will define the next era of software development?

Thank you. I'm happy to take your questions.
