# The IDE Integration Approach

<!--
*"Seamless collaboration within development environment"*

**Lego:** Expert builder selecting their own pieces

**Parenting:** Collaborative decision-making with teenagers

The IDE integration approach represents the current state of the art for many developers. The AI becomes a collaborative partner right within your development environment.

Like an expert Lego builder who knows exactly which pieces they need and can select them efficiently, or collaborative decision-making with teenagers who can contribute meaningfully to family choices.

**When it works well:** Real-time development assistance, code completion, contextual suggestions
**Current considerations:** Still requires the developer to manage context and guide the interaction, but very effective for immediate productivity gains
