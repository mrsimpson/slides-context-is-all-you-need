# Practical Implementation

<!--
Context Engineering in practice involves four key activities:

**Context Discovery:** Understanding what information exists in your system - code, documentation, logs, user feedback, business requirements.

**Context Filtering:** Determining what's relevant for the current task and phase. This is where the art comes in.

**Context Delivery:** Providing the right information in the right format at the right time. This might be through APIs, file inclusion, or structured prompts.

**Context Adaptation:** Observing how the AI system responds and adjusting your context strategy accordingly.

This is engineering work - systematic, measurable, and improvable.
