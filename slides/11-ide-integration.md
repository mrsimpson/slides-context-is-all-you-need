# The IDE Integration Approach

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: IDE integration empowers developers with context control but creates cognitive burden for relevance decisions

- Developer control
- Context selection
- Cognitive load

*Transition: Now let's see the pattern that emerges.*

...

The IDE integration approach put control in the developer's hands. You select which files, which context, which information to share with the LLM. Like an expert Lego builder choosing exactly which pieces they need, or collaborative decision-making where you involve your teenager in choosing what information they need. While this works well for developer-controlled scenarios and focused tasks, it creates cognitive load on humans to assess context relevance - something mature AI systems could potentially handle independently.
