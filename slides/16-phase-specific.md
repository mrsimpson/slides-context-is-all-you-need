<!--
Here's the breakthrough insight that changed everything for me: relevant context is heavily dependent on the current development phase.

When you're starting a project, you need requirements, architecture documentation, and examples of similar projects. Detailed code implementations are irrelevant and just add noise.

When you're implementing, you need the relevant code files, established patterns, and API documentation. High-level requirements documents become noise.

When you're debugging, you need error logs, the specific code involved, and recent changes. Everything else is distraction.

This phase-awareness is what makes Context Engineering so powerful - it's not just about having information, it's about having the RIGHT information for what you're trying to accomplish right now.
