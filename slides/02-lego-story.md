# The Lego Story

I used to tell my daughter that programming is like professional Lego building - only the cleanup is faster. You carefully place each piece, following your mental blueprint, building something complex from simple components.

But recently, I had to update that explanation. Now I tell her: "I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot." The transformation has been that dramatic.

This image perfectly captures that transformation. On the left, we see the traditional approach - careful, methodical, piece-by-piece construction. On the right, we see the new reality - intelligent automation that understands intent and executes the vision.
