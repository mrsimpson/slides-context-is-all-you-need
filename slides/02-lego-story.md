# Software Engineering is about Building

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Programming has transformed from manual piece-by-piece work to natural language instruction of intelligent systems

- Professional Lego
- natural languages as interface
- Dramatic transformation

*Transition: But this raises a fundamental question.*

...

I used to explain programming to my daughter as "professional Lego building" where you place every piece yourself. Now I tell her it's like explaining to the computer in German what you want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot. This transformation has been that dramatic - we've moved from manual, methodical construction to intelligent automation that understands intent and context. This raises the fundamental question of how AI systems became so capable at understanding what we want.
