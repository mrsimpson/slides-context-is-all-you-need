# The Maturity Formula

**Technical Skills** + **Experience** = **Maturity**

â†“

**Maturity** + **Available Knowledge** = **Good Guessing**

<!-- 
Think about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call "good guessing."

The same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.
