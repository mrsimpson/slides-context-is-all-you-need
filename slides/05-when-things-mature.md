# What makes something "mature"?

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**
Main message: Maturity transitions can be subtle but the pattern is similar for humans and AI

- Have seen many things
- Know relations
- Make use of tools

*Transition: For LLMs, we know exactly where this capability of improving over time with more knowledge originated.*

**Reader Notes:**

What exactly makes something mature? Maturity comes from having seen many things, knowing the relations between them, and being able to make use of tools effectively. When does a child become capable of handling complex decisions with just context and boundaries instead of step-by-step instructions? We don't always recognize maturity when it happens, but at least for text-based GenAI, we can trace where it comes from - and understanding this source is crucial for working effectively with mature AI systems.
