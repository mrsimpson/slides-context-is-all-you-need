<!--
The agent approach emerged as a sophisticated solution - separate systems for different functions. One agent searches files, another analyzes dependencies, a third makes decisions about relevance.

Like an assembly line where each worker has a specific role, or structured family activities where everyone has clear responsibilities.

**When it works well:** Complex workflows, specialized tasks that benefit from dedicated focus
**Current considerations:** Can limit the natural flexibility of mature LLMs, but valuable for certain enterprise use cases
