# We know where LLM maturity comes from:

<div class="text-2xl">
<div class="i-uim-focus inline text-green-500 mr-2"></div> *"Attention is all you need"*

<div class="text-2xl">
<div class="i-uim-database inline text-orange-500 mr-2"></div> *Context matters*
</div>

<!--
The maturity of modern LLMs comes from a specific architectural breakthrough: Transformers. The 2017 paper "Attention is all you need" wasn't just a catchy title - it was a fundamental insight.

The ability to direct attention means the ability to focus on relevant context. And when you can focus on the right context at the right time, you can make much better decisions.

This isn't just about LLMs getting bigger or having more parameters. It's about a fundamental capability that enables context-aware processing. The architecture that makes good guessing possible.
