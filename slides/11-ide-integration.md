<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Manual context selection</div>
</div>

<!--
The IDE integration approach put control in the developer's hands. You select which files, which context, which information to share with the LLM.

Like an expert Lego builder choosing exactly which pieces they need, or collaborative decision-making where you involve your teenager in choosing what information they need.

**When it works well:** Developer-controlled scenarios, focused tasks with clear scope
**Current challenges:** Creates cognitive load on humans to assess context relevance, but still relevant for targeted work
