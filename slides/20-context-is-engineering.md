# Context Engineering is Engineering

<!--
**Speaker Notes:**

Here's the crucial point: Context Engineering is engineering. It's not a soft skill or a nice-to-have. It's a core engineering discipline that requires the same rigor and expertise as any other engineering practice.

Traditional engineering is about building systems that work reliably and efficiently. Context Engineering is about providing information that enables intelligent systems to work effectively.

Both require deep understanding, systematic thinking, and continuous refinement. Both are essential for success in their respective domains.

The difference is in what we're building: Traditional engineers build systems that work. Context engineers provide information that enables intelligence. Different skills, same importance.
