Während alle über Prompt Engineering sprechen, liegt der wahre Schlüssel im intelligenten Management von relevantem Kontext zur richtigen Zeit. Die Zukunft gehört post-agentistischen Ansätzen, die LLMs flexibel mit Tools arbeiten lassen.\n\nWie schon geschrieben erlebe ich als Entwickler gerade die größte Umwälzung unserer Profession seit der Einführung des Internets. Während ich früher meiner Tochter erklärte, dass Programmieren wie professionelles Lego-Bauen sei (nur dass das Aufräumen schneller geht), muss ich heute hinzufügen: \"Und neuerdings erkläre ich dem Computer auf Deutsch, was ich bauen möchte. Und dann macht er einen wie ein Lego-Bau-Roboter das großteils selbst\"\n\nDabei frage ich mich immer wieder: Wie kann es sein, dass diese LLMs so verdammt gut raten? \"Verstehen\" im menschlichen Sinne tun sie ja nicht, egal wie oft sie das behaupten. Dann denke ich an Transformer und das berühmte Paper \"Attention is all you need\" aus 2017. Und dann wird mir klar: Man kann Aufmerksamkeit lenken.\n\nWie immer bin ich natürlich nicht der einzige mit dem Gedanken, am besten brachte es Tobi Lütke, der Nerd-CEO von Shopify, kürzlich auf den Punkt:\n\n![\"I really like the term 'context engineering' over prompt engineering. It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.\"](./images/12_twitter_context.png)\n\n## Context Engineering schlägt Prompt Engineering\n\nDieser Perspektivwechsel ist fundamental. Prompt Engineering fragt: \"Wie soll das LLM arbeiten?\" Context Engineering fragt: \"Welche Informationen braucht es?\"\n\nEs ist wie der Unterschied zwischen einem Mikromanager und einem guten Teamleiter. Der Mikromanager erklärt jeden Arbeitsschritt im Detail. Der gute Teamleiter sorgt dafür, dass alle relevanten Informationen verfügbar sind und lässt das Team dann arbeiten.\n\n**Praktisches Beispiel:**\n- **Prompt Engineering**: \"Schreibe sauberen, gut dokumentierten Code mit Error Handling und folge den SOLID-Prinzipien...\"\n=> Imperativ\n\n- **Context Engineering**: Hier sind die bestehende Architektur, die Coding Standards, die aktuellen Tests und ähnliche Implementierungen im Projekt.\n=> Kontextuell explorativ\n\n## Die Grenzen bisheriger Ansätze\n\nIn den letzten zwei Jahren habe ich verschiedene Ansätze zur Kontext-Bereitstellung beobachtet und selbst ausprobiert:\n\n### Der Mega-Prompt Ansatz\n**Die Idee**: Alles in einen riesigen System Prompt packen - von Coding Standards über Architektur-Prinzipien bis hin zu Deployment-Prozessen.\n\n**Das Problem**: Diese Prompts werden schnell unübersichtlich, stoßen an Token-Limits und verwässern durch irrelevante Informationen. Ein 5000-Zeichen Prompt mit allem von API-Dokumentation bis zu Git-Workflows hilft nicht, wenn ich nur einen kleinen Bug fixen will.\n\n### Der Agenten-Ansatz\n**Die Idee**: Separate Systeme sammeln und filtern automatisch den relevanten Kontext. Ein Agent durchsucht Files, ein anderer analysiert Dependencies, ein dritter entscheidet über Relevanz.\n\n**Das Problem**: Agenten arbeiten imperativ und bremsen die natürliche Flexibilität von LLMs aus. Sie fügen eine zusätzliche Abstraktionsschicht hinzu, die oft mehr Probleme schafft als löst. Das LLM wird zum passiven Empfänger statt zum aktiven Orchestrator.\n\n### Der IDE-Integration Ansatz\n**Die Idee**: Der Entwickler wählt relevante Files und Kontext aus, die IDE übergibt diese an das LLM.\n\n**Das Problem**: Das überfordert uns Menschen. Welche 10 von 200 Files sind für diese Änderung relevant? Wir sind schlecht darin, Kontext-Relevanz einzuschätzen, besonders bei komplexen Systemen. Außerdem ist es inkonsistent - jeder macht es anders.\n\n## Die Erkenntnis: Phasenspezifisches Wissen\n\nDer Durchbruch kam für mich mit der Erkenntnis, dass relevanter Kontext stark von der aktuellen Entwicklungsphase abhängt.\n\n### Projektstart-Phase\n**Relevante Fragen**: \"Mach dich mit dem Projekt vertraut\", \"Welche ähnlichen Lösungen gibt es bereits?\"\n\n**Benötigter Kontext**: README-Files, Architektur-Dokumentation, ähnliche Projekte, High-Level Requirements\n\n**Irrelevant**: Detaillierte Code-Implementierungen, spezifische Bug-Reports, Performance-Metriken\n\n### Design-Phase\n**Relevante Fragen**: \"Welche nicht-funktionalen Anforderungen gibt es?\", \"Welche Technologien passen zum Problem?\", \"Visualisiere eine Architektur\"\n\n**Benötigter Kontext**: Requirements, bestehender Tech-Stack, Performance-Constraints, Sicherheitsanforderungen\n\n**Irrelevant**: Einzelne Code-Files, detaillierte Test-Implementierungen\n\n### Implementation-Phase\n**Relevante Fragen**: \"Implementiere Feature X\", \"Schreibe passende Tests\"\n\n**Benötigter Kontext**: Relevante Code-Files, Test-Patterns, API-Dokumentation, ähnliche Implementierungen\n\n**Irrelevant**: High-Level Architektur-Diskussionen, Requirements-Dokumente\n\nDiese Phasen-Abhängigkeit zeigt: One-Size-Fits-All funktioniert nicht. Wir brauchen intelligente, kontextuelle Ansätze.\n\n## Meine persönliche Evolution\n\nMein eigener Weg illustriert diese Entwicklung perfekt. Anfangs half ich mir mit System Prompts, die das LLM instruierten, einen Entwicklungsplan fortzuschreiben. Das funktionierte überraschend gut und ermöglichte Wiederaufsetzbarkeit - ich konnte Projekte nach Unterbrechungen nahtlos fortsetzen.\n\n**Was funktionierte**: Strukturiertes Vorgehen, Dokumentation des Fortschritts, Wiederaufsetzbarkeit\n\n**Wo die Grenzen lagen**: Der Ansatz war starr und unflexibel. Der System Prompt musste alles vorwegnehmen und war schwierig an verschiedene Projekt-Typen anzupassen. Ich instruierte das LLM, wie es arbeiten sollte, statt ihm den richtigen Kontext zu geben.\n\n**Die Erkenntnis**: Das LLM braucht nicht detaillierte Arbeitsanweisungen, sondern den richtigen Kontext zur richtigen Zeit.\n\nDas brachte mich zum Nachdenken über post-agentistische Ansätze.\n\n## Post-Agentistische Zukunft: Die Lösung\n\nIch beobachte, dass LLMs immer besser darin werden, sich flexibel verschiedener Werkzeuge zu bedienen - besonders durch Standards wie das Model Context Protocol (MCP). Agenten hingegen schränken diese natürliche Flexibilität ein. Sie sind ein imperativer Ansatz, der möglicherweise nicht für jedes LLM optimal passt.\n\n**Meine neue Lösung**: Ein MCP Server, der ohne System Prompts und phasen-bewusst arbeitet. Das LLM kann selbst erkennen, in welcher Entwicklungsphase es sich befindet, und sich den relevanten Kontext holen.\n\n**Wie es funktioniert**:\n- Das LLM orchestriert selbst, wann welcher Kontext relevant ist\n- Keine starren Agenten-Pipelines, sondern flexible Tool-Nutzung\n- Phasen-Bewusstsein ohne imperative Vorgaben\n- Natürliche Gedächtnisbildung durch kontextuelle Persistierung\n\n**Die Vorteile**:\n- **Wiederaufsetzbarkeit** ohne starre Struktur\n- **Flexibilität** für verschiedene Projekt-Typen und Entwicklungsstile\n- **Natürlichere Interaktion** - das LLM arbeitet, wie es am besten kann\n- **Selbst-Orchestrierung** - das LLM lernt, wann welcher Kontext relevant ist\n\nDiese post-agentistische Vision bedeutet: LLMs bauen eigenständig Gedächtnis auf und lernen Kontext-Relevanz, ohne dass wir ihnen jeden Schritt vorschreiben müssen.\n\n## Fazit: Werkzeuge für individuelle Stärken\n\nContext Engineering wird zur Schlüsselkompetenz der Zukunft. Aber - und das ist wichtig - jeder Entwickler arbeitet anders und hat unterschiedliche Stärken und Schwächen.\n\nDie Werkzeuge der Zukunft sollten daher individuell anpassbar sein:\n- **Gut in Architektur?** → Das Tool liefert relevante Design-Patterns und Architektur-Beispiele\n- **Schwach in Dokumentation?** → Das Tool generiert automatisch Dokumentation aus dem Kontext\n- **Vergisst Edge Cases?** → Das Tool erinnert an typische Fallstricke und Grenzfälle\n- **Stark in Problemlösung?** → Das Tool fokussiert auf relevante Code-Beispiele und APIs\n\nMeine Überzeugung: **Die Zukunft gehört nicht denen, die am besten prompten, sondern denen, die am besten das bereitstellen, was das LLM wissen muss, um effektiv und effizient zu arbeiten.**\n\n---\n\n*Dieser Blogpost ist Teil meiner Serie über die Transformation der Softwareentwicklung durch KI.

Let me work through the key ideation questions with you:\n\n## 🎯 **Presentation Concept Analysis**\n\nYour blog post has a compelling narrative arc:\n1. **Personal transformation** - Your experience as a developer in the AI era\n2. **The core insight** - Context Engineering > Prompt Engineering (inspired by Tobi Lütke's quote)\n3. **Problem analysis** - Why current approaches (mega-prompts, agents, IDE integration) fall short\n4. **The breakthrough** - Phase-specific context awareness\n5. **Your solution** - Post-agentistic MCP-based approach\n6. **Vision** - Individualized tools for different developer strengths\n\n## 🎪 **Key Questions for You:**\n\n**1. Target Audience & Context:**\n- Who will be watching this presentation? (Developers, tech leads, conference audience, internal team?)\n- What's their current knowledge level with AI/LLM tools?\n- What's the setting? (Conference talk, team meeting, workshop?)\n\n**2. Presentation Goals:**\n- Primary goal: Educate about Context Engineering concept?\n- Secondary goals: Promote your MCP solution? Change how people think about AI tooling?\n- What should the audience do differently after your talk?\n\n**3. Format & Constraints:**\n- How long is your presentation slot?\n- Will there be Q&A time?\n- Any specific requirements or constraints?\n\n**4. Key Messages Priority:**\n- Which concepts are absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?\n- Should we focus more on the problem analysis or your solution?\n\nLet me know your thoughts on these questions, and I'll help shape the presentation concept accordingly!"

Now let me work through the remaining ideation elements:\n\n## 🎭 **Core Narrative Arc for 30-Minute Conference Talk**\n\nBased on your goals, I see this structure emerging:\n\n**Opening Hook** (2-3 mins)\n- Your personal transformation story: \"Explaining to my daughter that programming is like professional Lego building... but now I explain to the computer in German what I want to build\"\n- The fundamental question: How can LLMs be so good at guessing?\n\n**The Problem** (8-10 mins)\n- Current approaches and their limitations:\n  - Mega-prompt approach (everything in system prompt)\n  - Agent approach (imperative, inflexible)\n  - IDE integration (human overwhelm)\n- The core insight: \"Attention is all you need\" → Context is all you need\n\n**The Solution** (15-18 mins)\n- Context Engineering as a distinct engineering discipline\n- Phase-specific context awareness (your breakthrough insight)\n- Post-agentistic vision: LLMs as flexible orchestrators\n- Your MCP solution as practical implementation\n\n**Call to Action** (2-3 mins)\n- Context Engineering as the key skill for AI-era developers\n- Tools should adapt to individual developer strengths\n\n## 🎯 **Key Questions to Finalize Ideation:**\n\n**1. Visual Metaphors & Examples:**\n- Should we use your Lego metaphor throughout?\n- Any specific code examples or demos you want to include?\n- Visual representations of \"context\" vs \"prompts\"?\n\n**2. Audience Engagement:**\n- Any interactive elements? (polls, show of hands, etc.)\n- Stories/examples that will resonate with this audience?\n\n**3. Technical Depth:**\n- How deep into MCP technical details?\n- Should we show actual code/configuration examples?\n\n**4. Scope Refinement:**\n- From your blog: personal evolution story, all three failed approaches, or focus on the most relevant ones?\n- Include the \"individual developer strengths\" section or save for Q&A?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these elements? This will help me complete the ideation phase and move to structuring the presentation flow."

          "content": "Great refinements! Now let's explore metaphors - this is crucial for making Context Engineering tangible for your audience.\n\n## 🧱 **The Lego Metaphor - Extended**\n\n**Programming as Lego Building:**\n- Traditional coding: You manually place each brick, following instructions\n- AI-assisted: You describe the castle to a Lego robot, it builds it\n- **But here's the key**: The robot needs to see the instruction manual, know what pieces are available, understand the building context\n\n**Context Engineering as Lego Mastery:**\n- **Prompt Engineering**: Telling the robot HOW to build (\"Place red brick on blue brick, then...\")\n- **Context Engineering**: Giving the robot the RIGHT INFORMATION to build well (instruction manual, piece inventory, similar builds, building constraints)\n\n**Visual potential**: Could show evolution from manual building → instructing robot → providing context to robot\n\n## 🎭 **Alternative Metaphors to Consider**\n\n**1. The Orchestra Conductor**\n- **Traditional coding**: You play every instrument yourself\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You give detailed instructions to each musician\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide the sheet music, set the mood, give musicians the context they need to perform beautifully\n- *Strength*: Emphasizes orchestration and harmony\n\n**2. The Master Chef / Sous Chef**\n- **Traditional coding**: You cook everything yourself\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You give step-by-step cooking instructions\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide the recipe, ingredients, kitchen setup, and culinary context\n- *Strength*: Familiar to everyone, emphasizes preparation and context\n\n**3. The GPS Navigation**\n- **Traditional coding**: You memorize every street and navigate manually\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You give turn-by-turn directions\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide the map, traffic conditions, destination context, and let the system find the best route\n- *Strength*: Everyone uses GPS, emphasizes intelligent routing\n\n**4. The Personal Assistant**\n- **Traditional coding**: You do all tasks yourself\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You micromanage every task step-by-step\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide context about your preferences, schedule, priorities, and let them work intelligently\n- *Strength*: Relatable, emphasizes trust and autonomy\n\n## 🤔 **Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Which metaphor resonates most with you?** The Lego one has personal connection from your blog, but others might be more universally relatable.\n\n2. **Consistency throughout**: Should we stick to one metaphor throughout the entire presentation, or use different ones for different concepts?\n\n3. **Visual execution**: Which metaphor would work best visually on slides? (Lego has great visual potential, but so does the conductor/orchestra)\n\n4. **Audience connection**: Which metaphor do you think will click best with developers and dev managers?\n\nThe metaphor choice will significantly influence how we structure the presentation and create visuals. What's your gut feeling?"

Let me work this out:\n\n## 🎯 **Dual Metaphor Strategy**\n\n**Opening Setup** (Your personal story):\n- \"I used to tell my daughter programming is like professional Lego building...\"\n- \"Now I tell her it's like having a really smart assistant who can also build with Lego\"\n\n## 🧱 **Lego Metaphor (For Developers)**\n\n**Traditional Coding**: You place every brick manually\n**Prompt Engineering**: \"Place red brick here, blue brick there, now connect them...\"\n**Context Engineering**: Give the builder the instruction manual, show similar builds, provide the right pieces\n\n## 👔 **Personal Assistant Metaphor (For Managers)**\n\n**Traditional Management**: You do every task yourself\n**Prompt Engineering**: Micromanaging every step (\"First call John, then email Sarah, then...\")\n**Context Engineering**: Provide context about priorities, relationships, goals - let them work intelligently\n\n## 🎭 **How to Use Both Briefly**\n\n**Slide Structure Idea**:\n1. **Opening**: Your daughter story (introduces both)\n2. **Problem Definition**: Use both metaphors side by side\n   - \"Whether you're building with Lego or managing with assistants...\"\n3. **Solutions Comparison**: Show both perspectives\n   - Lego builder getting wrong instructions vs. right context\n   - Assistant getting micromanaged vs. empowered with context\n\n**Visual Potential**:\n- Split-screen slides showing both metaphors\n- Same concept, two perspectives\n- Reinforces the message for both audience segments\n\n## 🤔 **Quick Check**:\n\nDoes this approach feel right? The beauty is:\n- **Developers** connect with the technical Lego building\n- **Managers** relate to the assistant delegation\n- **Both** understand the core message: Context > Instructions\n\nShould we proceed with this dual approach, or would you like to refine it further?"

This is much more powerful than the personal assistant metaphor.\n\n## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Lego + Parenting Dual Metaphor**\n\n**Your Opening Story Evolution**:\n- \"I used to tell my daughter programming is like professional Lego building...\"\n- \"Now I tell her it's like being a parent - you provide the right environment and boundaries, then let them figure it out\"\n\n## 🧱 **Lego Metaphor (For Developers)**\n**Traditional Coding**: You place every brick manually\n**Prompt Engineering**: \"Place red brick here, blue brick there...\" (micromanaging the builder)\n**Context Engineering**: Provide the instruction manual, similar builds, available pieces, and let them build\n\n## 👶 **Parenting Metaphor (For Managers)**\n**Traditional Management**: You do everything yourself (helicopter parenting)\n**Prompt Engineering**: \"First brush your teeth, then put on pajamas, then...\" (micromanaging every step)\n**Context Engineering**: Set clear boundaries, provide context about expectations, let them make good decisions\n\n## 🎯 **The Maturity Insight (BRILLIANT Addition!)**\n\n**Early Childhood** (Early LLMs):\n- Needed step-by-step instructions\n- Couldn't handle complex context\n- Required constant supervision\n\n**Mature Children** (Modern LLMs):\n- Can work with boundaries and context\n- Make good decisions within established frameworks\n- Thrive with autonomy and clear expectations\n\n**The Parallel**: \"Just like children, LLMs needed to mature before context-based approaches could work. We're now at that maturity point.\"\n\n## 🎭 **Presentation Flow with Both Metaphors**\n\n1. **Opening**: Your daughter story introduces both concepts naturally\n2. **The Evolution**: \"Both Lego building and parenting evolved as capabilities matured\"\n3. **Problem Analysis**: Show micromanagement vs. context in both domains\n4. **The Solution**: Context Engineering works because the \"children\" (LLMs) are now mature enough\n\n## 🔥 **Why This Works So Well**\n\n- **Universal relatability**: Most of your audience are parents or have been children\n- **Emotional connection**: Parenting resonates deeper than work metaphors\n- **Natural progression**: Shows why NOW is the right time for Context Engineering\n- **Explains resistance**: \"We're still parenting LLMs like toddlers when they're now teenagers\"\n\nThis metaphor combination is really powerful! Should we proceed with this approach? It gives us rich material for the entire presentation arc."

Let me refine this:\n\n## 🎭 **Refined Opening Story Structure**\n\n**What I Tell My Daughter** (Public narrative):\n- \"Programming used to be like professional Lego building - you place every piece yourself\"\n- \"Now I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot\"\n\n**What I Don't Tell Her** (Private reflection):\n- \"But honestly? It's more like parenting...\"\n- \"I don't tell her this because, well, she's not quite ready to manage everything independently yet\"\n- \"But with LLMs, just like with children, the secret isn't giving step-by-step instructions...\"\n- \"It's providing the right context and boundaries, then trusting them to figure it out\"\n\n## 🎯 **Why This Works Brilliantly**\n\n**Authenticity**: Every parent in the audience will immediately connect with this\n**Humor**: The gentle admission that your daughter isn't ready for full autonomy\n**Relatability**: We all have things we think but don't say to our kids\n**Natural Bridge**: Sets up the maturity theme perfectly\n\n## 🔄 **Flow Into Main Content**\n\n**The Transition**:\n- \"And that's the thing - both children and LLMs needed to reach a certain maturity before context-based approaches could work\"\n- \"We're now at that point with LLMs, but we're still treating them like toddlers\"\n\n**Audience Hook**:\n- \"How many of you have caught yourselves micromanaging an AI tool the same way you might micromanage a 5-year-old?\"\n\nThis opening is going to be memorable and immediately establish rapport with your audience. The secret/private thought element adds intimacy and humor that will draw people in.\n\nShould we now move to completing the ideation phase and transition to structuring the full presentation flow?"

The Evolution** (5 minutes)\n**Slides 4-7**\n- **From Manual to Assisted**: Both Lego building and parenting evolved\n- **The Maturity Factor**: Children and LLMs needed to grow up\n- **Current State**: We're still treating mature LLMs like toddlers\n- **The Core Insight**: \"Attention is all you need\" → \"Context is all you need\"\n\n**Transition**: \"But let's look at how we got here...\"\n\n### **III. The Problem - Failed Approaches** (10 minutes)\n**Slides 8-15**\n\n**A. The Mega-Prompt Approach** (3 mins)\n- **Lego Metaphor**: Giving the builder a 50-page instruction manual for every build\n- **Parenting Metaphor**: Writing detailed rules for every possible situation\n- **The Problem**: Information overload, irrelevant context\n\n**B. The Agent Approach** (3 mins)\n- **Lego Metaphor**: Having separate robots for finding pieces, reading instructions, building\n- **Parenting Metaphor**: Hiring specialists for every parenting task\n- **The Problem**: Inflexibility, added complexity\n\n**C. The IDE Integration Approach** (4 mins)\n- **Lego Metaphor**: You manually select which pieces the builder can see\n- **Parenting Metaphor**: You decide what information your teenager gets\n- **The Problem**: Human overwhelm, inconsistency\n\n**Audience Engagement**: \"Which of these approaches have you tried?\"\n\n### **IV. The Solution - Context Engineering** (10 minutes)\n**Slides 16-23**\n\n**A. Context Engineering as Engineering Discipline** (3 mins)\n- **Definition**: Providing the right information at the right time\n- **Lego Metaphor**: Giving the builder the right manual, pieces, and examples for THIS build\n- **Parenting Metaphor**: Setting appropriate boundaries and context for THIS situation\n\n**B. Phase-Specific Context** (4 mins)\n- **The Breakthrough**: Different phases need different context\n- **Examples**: Project start vs. implementation vs. debugging\n- **Visual**: Context relevance matrix\n\n**C. Post-Agentistic Vision** (3 mins)\n- **LLMs as Orchestrators**: Let them choose their tools\n- **Your MCP Solution**: Brief mention, no technical details\n- **The Future**: Flexible, context-aware collaboration\n\n### **V. Call to Action** (2 minutes)\n**Slides 24-26**\n- **Context Engineering is Engineering**: Different skills, same importance\n- **Sharpen Your Tools**: Engineers must evolve to remain relevant\n- **The Opportunity**: Those who master context engineering will thrive\n\n**Final Thought**: \"The future belongs not to those who prompt best, but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively\"\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ **Timing Breakdown**\n- Opening: 3 min\n- Evolution: 5 min  \n- Problems: 10 min\n- Solution: 10 min\n- Call to Action: 2 min\n- **Total: 30 minutes**\n\n## 🎭 **Engagement Points**\n1. Opening: \"How many explained your job to kids?\"\n2. Problems: \"Which approaches have you tried?\"\n3. Throughout: Metaphor connections\n4. Q&A: Individual developer strengths discussion\n\nDoes this structure feel right for your conference talk? Should we adjust the timing or flow of any sections?"

We have:\n✅ Detailed 30-minute presentation outline\n✅ Clear narrative progression with dual metaphors\n✅ Smooth transitions and timing\n✅ Visual requirements planned\n✅ Content mapped from blog to slides\n✅ Key examples identified\n\nReady to move to the draft phase where we'll create the actual slide content and speaker notes.

Let me revise the structure to reflect this important distinction:\n\n## 🎯 **Revised Structure - \"Evolution, Not Failure\"**\n\n### **III. The Evolution - Different Approaches for Different Maturities** (10 minutes)\n**Slides 8-15**\n\n**A. The Mega-Prompt Approach** (3 mins)\n- **When it worked**: Early LLMs needed detailed instructions\n- **Lego Metaphor**: Training a new builder with comprehensive manuals\n- **Parenting Metaphor**: Detailed guidance for young children\n- **Current limitations**: Information overload with mature LLMs, but still useful for specific scenarios\n\n**B. The Agent Approach** (3 mins)\n- **When it works**: Complex workflows, specialized tasks\n- **Lego Metaphor**: Assembly line with specialized workers\n- **Parenting Metaphor**: Structured activities with clear roles\n- **Current considerations**: Can limit flexibility, but valuable for certain use cases\n\n**C. The IDE Integration Approach** (4 mins)\n- **When it works**: Developer-controlled context selection\n- **Lego Metaphor**: Expert builder choosing their own pieces\n- **Parenting Metaphor**: Collaborative decision-making with teenagers\n- **Current challenges**: Human cognitive load, but still relevant for focused tasks\n\n**Key Message**: \"These weren't failures - they were stepping stones. Each approach served its purpose at different maturity levels.\"\n\n### **IV. The Next Evolution - Context Engineering** (10 minutes)\n**Slides 16-23**\n\n**A. Context Engineering as Natural Progression** (3 mins)\n- **Why now**: LLMs have reached the maturity for context-based collaboration\n- **Not replacement**: Addition to our toolkit\n- **The opportunity**: Leverage mature LLM capabilities more effectively\n\nThis reframing is much better! It shows respect for the evolution of the field and acknowledges that different approaches have their place. It also makes your argument stronger - you're not dismissing previous work, but building on it.\n\nShould we proceed with this more nuanced approach to the draft phase?"

Let me start creating the actual presentation content, beginning with the opening section and comprehensive speaker notes.\n\n## 🎭 **Draft: \"Context is All You Need\" - Slide Content & Speaker Notes**\n\n### **SLIDE 1: Title Slide**\n**On Screen:**\n# Context is All You Need\n*Why Context Engineering is the Key Skill for AI-Era Developers*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nGood morning! I'm here to talk about what I believe is the most important skill shift happening in software development right now. And it starts with a conversation I had with my daughter.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 2: The Lego Story**\n**On Screen:**\n*\"Programming used to be like professional Lego building - you place every piece yourself\"*\n\n*\"Now I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot\"*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nI used to tell my daughter that programming is like professional Lego building - only the cleanup is faster. You carefully place each piece, following your mental blueprint, building something complex from simple components.\n\nBut recently, I had to update that explanation. Now I tell her: \"I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot.\" The transformation has been that dramatic.\n\nBut here's the thing...\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 3: The Question & The Secret**\n**On Screen:**\n**The Question:** *How can LLMs be so good at guessing?*\n\n**The Secret:** *It's actually more like parenting...*\n*(But I don't tell her that - she's not quite ready for full independence yet)*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis raises a fundamental question: How can these LLMs be so incredibly good at guessing what we want?\n\nAnd here's what I don't tell my daughter - because honestly, she's not quite ready to manage everything independently yet - but working with LLMs is actually more like parenting than Lego building.\n\nJust like with children, the secret isn't giving step-by-step instructions for everything. It's providing the right context and boundaries, then trusting them to figure it out.\n\n**[Audience Engagement]** How many of you have tried to explain your job to your kids? *[Show of hands, brief interaction]*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 4: The Maturity Question**\n**On Screen:**\n**What makes an LLM \"mature\"?**\n- When it turns 18? 🎂\n- When it passes a test? 📝\n- When it gets a job? 💼\n\n*Probably not...*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nBut this raises an interesting question: What exactly makes an LLM \"mature\"? \n\nWhen does it turn 18? When it passes some standardized test? When it gets its first job?\n\nObviously not. But here's the thing about software maturity - we often don't recognize it until we look back and understand where it came from.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 5: The Technical Foundation**\n**On Screen:**\n**We don't know when software is mature...**\n**But we know where it comes from:**\n\n*Transformers Architecture*\n↓\n*\"Attention is all you need\"*\n↓\n*Context matters*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nDo we really know when software is mature? Not always. But we do know where this maturity comes from.\n\nIt comes from the Transformers architecture. The breakthrough paper \"Attention is all you need\" from 2017. The fundamental insight that you can direct attention - and that means context matters.\n\nThis isn't just about LLMs getting bigger or faster. It's about a fundamental architectural capability that enables context-aware processing.\n\n---\n\nLet me continue with the next sections. Should I proceed with the Evolution section content, or would you like to review and refine what I have so far?"

It's providing the right context and boundaries, then trusting them to figure it out.\n\nBut here's the key insight - this approach only works when both children AND LLMs have reached a certain level of maturity.

Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call \"good guessing.\"\n\nThe same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.\n\nNow, here's what I don't tell my daughter about this whole programming-as-parenting thing - she's not quite ready for full independence yet.

When does an LLM reach that same point?\n\nWe don't always recognize maturity when it happens, but we can trace where it comes from.

The 2017 paper \"Attention is all you need\" wasn't just a catchy title - it was a fundamental insight.\n\nThe ability to direct attention means the ability to focus on relevant context. And when you can focus on the right context at the right time, you can make much better decisions.\n\nThis isn't just about LLMs getting bigger or having more parameters.

Let me revise:\n\n### **SLIDE 4: The Maturity Formula**\n**On Screen:**\n**Technical Skills + Experience = Maturity**\n\n**Maturity + Available Knowledge = Good Guessing**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThink about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call \"good guessing.\"\n\nThe same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 7: The Current State & Opportunity**\n**On Screen:**\n**LLMs have matured**\n*Just like children, they're ready for more independence*\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n*Context-based collaboration instead of step-by-step instructions*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's what I don't tell my daughter about this programming-as-parenting parallel - she's not quite ready for full independence with complex logical tasks yet. But LLMs? They've reached that level of maturity.\n\nJust like more mature children can handle tasks more independently when given the right context and boundaries, these models are now ready for more sophisticated context handling rather than detailed step-by-step instructions.\n\nThe opportunity is enormous. We can move from micromanaging every step to providing the right context and letting them work intelligently within those boundaries.\n\nBut to understand why this shift matters so much, let's look at the approaches we've been using and how they evolved with different levels of LLM maturity...\n\n---\n\nThis flows much better! The daughter reference now serves as a positive bridge to highlight LLM readiness rather than creating confusion earlier.

One agent searches files, another analyzes dependencies, a third makes decisions about relevance.\n\nLike an assembly line where each worker has a specific role, or structured family activities where everyone has clear responsibilities.\n\n**When it works well:** Complex workflows, specialized tasks that benefit from dedicated focus\n**Current considerations:** Can limit the natural flexibility of mature LLMs, but valuable for certain enterprise use cases\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 11: The IDE Integration Approach**\n**On Screen:**\n**The IDE Integration Approach**\n*\"Developer chooses the context\"*\n\n🧱 **Lego:** Expert builder selecting their own pieces\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parenting:** Collaborative decision-making with teenagers\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe IDE integration approach put control in the developer's hands. You select which files, which context, which information to share with the LLM.\n\nLike an expert Lego builder choosing exactly which pieces they need, or collaborative decision-making where you involve your teenager in choosing what information they need.\n\n**When it works well:** Developer-controlled scenarios, focused tasks with clear scope\n**Current challenges:** Creates cognitive load on humans to assess context relevance, but still relevant for targeted work\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 12: The Pattern**\n**On Screen:**\n**Each Approach Matched Its Time**\n\nEarly LLMs → Detailed Instructions\nCapable LLMs → Structured Workflows  \nMature LLMs → **Context Collaboration**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's the pattern: each approach matched the maturity level of the LLMs available at the time. Early LLMs needed detailed instructions. More capable LLMs could handle structured workflows. \n\nBut now we have mature LLMs that are ready for something different: true context-based collaboration.\n\nThe question isn't which approach was right or wrong - it's recognizing when it's time to evolve to the next level.\n\nShould I continue with the Context Engineering solution section?"

          "content": "### **SLIDE 13: The Next Evolution**\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Engineering**\n*The natural progression for mature LLMs*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nSo what's the next evolution? Context Engineering. This isn't about replacing the previous approaches - it's about recognizing that mature LLMs are ready for a fundamentally different kind of collaboration.\n\nJust like we adjust our parenting style as children mature, we need to adjust how we work with LLMs as they become more capable.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 14: Tobi Lütke's Insight**\n**On Screen:**\n*\"I really like the term 'context engineering' over prompt engineering. It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.\"*\n\n**— Tobi Lütke, CEO Shopify**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nTobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, captured this perfectly. Context Engineering isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental shift in perspective.\n\nPrompt Engineering asks: \"How should the LLM work?\"\nContext Engineering asks: \"What information does it need?\"\n\nIt's the difference between being a micromanager and being a good team leader. The micromanager explains every step. The good team leader ensures all relevant information is available and lets the team work.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 15: Context Engineering Defined**\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Engineering:**\n*Providing the right information at the right time*\n\n🧱 **Lego:** Right manual, pieces, and examples for THIS build\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parenting:** Appropriate boundaries and context for THIS situation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nContext Engineering is the discipline of providing the right information at the right time. \n\nIn Lego terms: instead of a generic instruction manual, you provide the specific manual, the right pieces, and relevant examples for THIS particular build.\n\nIn parenting terms: instead of universal rules, you provide appropriate boundaries and context for THIS specific situation, trusting their maturity to handle it well.\n\nThe key insight is specificity and trust in the system's capability to work intelligently within the provided context.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 16: The Breakthrough - Phase-Specific Context**\n**On Screen:**\n**Different Phases Need Different Context**\n\n📋 **Project Start:** Requirements, architecture, similar projects\n🔧 **Implementation:** Relevant code, patterns, APIs  \n🐛 **Debugging:** Error logs, related code, recent changes\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's the breakthrough insight that changed everything for me: relevant context is heavily dependent on the current development phase.\n\nWhen you're starting a project, you need requirements, architecture documentation, and examples of similar projects. Detailed code implementations are irrelevant and just add noise.\n\nWhen you're implementing, you need the relevant code files, established patterns, and API documentation. High-level requirements documents become noise.\n\nWhen you're debugging, you need error logs, the specific code involved, and recent changes. Everything else is distraction.\n\nThis phase-awareness is what makes Context Engineering so powerful - it's not just about having information, it's about having the RIGHT information for what you're trying to accomplish right now.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 17: Context Relevance Matrix**\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Relevance by Phase**\n\n| Information Type | Project Start | Implementation | Debugging |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Requirements     | ✅ Critical   | ❌ Noise      | ❌ Noise  |\n| Code Files       | ❌ Noise      | ✅ Critical   | ✅ Critical |\n| Error Logs       | ❌ Noise      | ❌ Noise      | ✅ Critical |\n| Architecture     | ✅ Critical   | ⚠️ Sometimes  | ❌ Noise  |\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis matrix illustrates the core principle. The same piece of information can be critical in one phase and pure noise in another.\n\nRequirements are critical when starting a project but become noise when you're deep in debugging. Error logs are essential for debugging but irrelevant when you're planning architecture.\n\nTraditional approaches either try to provide everything (information overload) or make humans decide what's relevant (cognitive overload). Context Engineering provides the right information for the current phase.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 18: Post-Agentistic Vision**\n**On Screen:**\n**LLMs as Flexible Orchestrators**\n*Not rigid agents, but intelligent collaborators*\n\n**The Future:** LLMs choose their own tools and context\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis leads us to what I call a post-agentistic vision. Instead of rigid agent pipelines that constrain LLM flexibility, we let mature LLMs orchestrate their own tool usage.\n\nThink about it: LLMs are getting better at using tools flexibly through standards like the Model Context Protocol. Why force them into rigid agent workflows when they can intelligently choose what they need?\n\nIt's like the difference between a strict assembly line and a skilled craftsperson who selects the right tools for each task. The craftsperson approach leverages the full capability of the mature system.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 19: Practical Implementation**\n**On Screen:**\n**How Context Engineering Works in Practice**\n\n1. **Phase Recognition:** System understands current development phase\n2. **Context Selection:** Provides relevant information for that phase  \n3. **Flexible Orchestration:** LLM chooses appropriate tools and approaches\n4. **Natural Memory:** Context builds understanding over time\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nIn practice, Context Engineering works through four key elements:\n\nFirst, the system recognizes what phase of development you're in - are you exploring, designing, implementing, or debugging?\n\nSecond, it provides the context that's relevant for that specific phase, filtering out the noise.\n\nThird, it lets the LLM orchestrate flexibly - choosing the right tools and approaches for the task at hand.\n\nFourth, it builds natural memory over time, so context accumulates and understanding deepens throughout the project.\n\nThis isn't about replacing human judgment - it's about augmenting it with intelligent context management.\n\nShould I continue with the final call-to-action section?"

It's not a soft skill or a nice-to-have. It's a core engineering discipline that requires the same rigor and expertise as any other engineering practice.\n\nTraditional engineering is about building systems that work reliably and efficiently. Context Engineering is about providing information that enables intelligent systems to work effectively.\n\nBoth require deep understanding, systematic thinking, and continuous refinement. Both are essential for success in their respective domains.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 21: The Skills Shift**\n**On Screen:**\n**Engineers Must Evolve to Remain Relevant**\n\n**New Core Skills:**\n- Information architecture for AI systems\n- Phase-aware context design  \n- Intelligent tool orchestration\n- Context quality assessment\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe message is clear: engineers must develop these new skills to remain relevant in the AI era. This isn't about replacing coding skills - it's about adding a new dimension to our expertise.\n\nWe need to become skilled at information architecture for AI systems, designing context that's aware of development phases, orchestrating intelligent tool usage, and assessing the quality of the context we provide.\n\nThese skills are as learnable and measurable as any other engineering discipline. The question is: will you develop them proactively, or will you be forced to catch up later?\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 22: The Opportunity**\n**On Screen:**\n**Those Who Master Context Engineering Will Thrive**\n\n**The Advantage:**\n- More effective AI collaboration\n- Better project outcomes  \n- Reduced cognitive load\n- Competitive differentiation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe opportunity for those who master Context Engineering is enormous. You'll collaborate more effectively with AI systems, achieve better project outcomes, reduce your own cognitive load, and create significant competitive differentiation.\n\nWhile others are still micromanaging AI tools or struggling with information overload, you'll be working in true partnership with mature AI systems.\n\nThis isn't just about being more productive - it's about fundamentally changing how software gets built and how problems get solved.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 23: Your Next Steps**\n**On Screen:**\n**Start Your Context Engineering Journey**\n\n1. **Assess** your current context supply methods\n2. **Experiment** with phase-aware context\n3. **Build** tools that support context engineering\n4. **Share** your learnings with the community\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nSo where do you start? First, honestly assess how you currently supply context to AI systems. Are you using mega-prompts? Agent workflows? Manual selection? Each has its place, but recognize the limitations.\n\nSecond, experiment with phase-aware context. Try providing different information based on what you're trying to accomplish. Notice the difference in AI responses.\n\nThird, consider building or adopting tools that support context engineering principles. This might be as simple as better organization of your development context, or as sophisticated as systems that automatically provide phase-relevant information.\n\nFinally, share your learnings. Context Engineering is still emerging as a discipline. Your experiments and insights contribute to the collective understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 24: Final Thought**\n**On Screen:**\n**\"The future belongs not to those who prompt best, but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively\"**\n\n**Context is all you need.**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nI'll leave you with this thought: The future belongs not to those who craft the cleverest prompts, but to those who understand how to provide what LLMs need to work effectively.\n\nJust like \"Attention is all you need\" unlocked the potential of Transformers, \"Context is all you need\" unlocks the potential of mature AI collaboration.\n\nThe tools are ready. The LLMs are mature. The question is: are you ready to engineer the context that will define the next era of software development?\n\nThank you. I'm happy to take your questions.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 25: Q&A**\n**On Screen:**\n**Questions & Discussion**\n\n*Individual developer strengths and Context Engineering adaptations*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n[This is where you can discuss how Context Engineering tools should adapt to individual developer strengths - the topic we saved for Q&A]\n\n---\n\nThe presentation is now complete! We have a full 30-minute conference talk with comprehensive speaker notes. Should we move to the style phase to work on visual design and presentation format?"

I'm here to talk about what I believe is the most important skill shift happening in software development right now. And it starts with a conversation I had with my daughter.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 2: The Lego Story\n\n**On Screen:**\n*\"Programming used to be like professional Lego building - you place every piece yourself\"*\n\n*\"Now I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot\"*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nI used to tell my daughter that programming is like professional Lego building - only the cleanup is faster. You carefully place each piece, following your mental blueprint, building something complex from simple components.\n\nBut recently, I had to update that explanation. Now I tell her: \"I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot.\" The transformation has been that dramatic.\n\n**[Audience Engagement]** How many of you have tried to explain your job to your kids? *[Show of hands, brief interaction]*\n\nBut here's the thing...\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 3: The Question\n\n**On Screen:**\n**How can LLMs be so good at guessing?**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis raises a fundamental question that I keep coming back to: How can these LLMs be so incredibly good at guessing what we want?\n\nThe answer isn't magic. It follows a pattern we recognize from human development...\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 4: The Maturity Formula\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Technical Skills + Experience = Maturity**\n\n**Maturity + Available Knowledge = Good Guessing**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThink about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call \"good guessing.\"\n\nThe same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 5: When Things Mature\n\n**On Screen:**\n**What makes something \"mature\"?**\n- A child? 🧒→🧑\n- An LLM? 🤖→🤖✨\n- Software? 💻→💻⚡\n\n*We don't always know when, but we know where it comes from...*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nWhat exactly makes something mature? When does a child become capable of handling complex decisions with just context and boundaries instead of step-by-step instructions? When does an LLM reach that same point?\n\nWe don't always recognize maturity when it happens, but we can trace where it comes from. And for LLMs, we know exactly where this capability originated...\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 6: The Technical Foundation\n\n**On Screen:**\n**We know where LLM maturity comes from:**\n\n*Transformers Architecture*\n↓\n*\"Attention is all you need\"*\n↓\n*Context matters*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe maturity of modern LLMs comes from a specific architectural breakthrough: Transformers. The 2017 paper \"Attention is all you need\" wasn't just a catchy title - it was a fundamental insight.\n\nThe ability to direct attention means the ability to focus on relevant context. And when you can focus on the right context at the right time, you can make much better decisions.\n\nThis isn't just about LLMs getting bigger or having more parameters. It's about a fundamental capability that enables context-aware processing. The architecture that makes good guessing possible.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 7: The Current State & Opportunity\n\n**On Screen:**\n**LLMs have matured**\n*Just like children, they're ready for more independence*\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n*Context-based collaboration instead of step-by-step instructions*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's what I don't tell my daughter about this programming-as-parenting parallel - she's not quite ready for full independence with complex logical tasks yet. But LLMs? They've reached that level of maturity.\n\nJust like more mature children can handle tasks more independently when given the right context and boundaries, these models are now ready for more sophisticated context handling rather than detailed step-by-step instructions.\n\nThe opportunity is enormous. We can move from micromanaging every step to providing the right context and letting them work intelligently within those boundaries.\n\nBut to understand why this shift matters so much, let's look at the approaches we've been using and how they evolved with different levels of LLM maturity...\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 8: Evolution Section Introduction\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Different Approaches for Different Maturities**\n*Each served its purpose at the right time*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nLet's look at how our approaches to working with LLMs have evolved. What's important to understand is that these weren't failures - they were appropriate responses to different levels of LLM maturity. Each approach served its purpose at the right time.\n\n**[Audience Engagement]** How do you supply context to your LLM? *[We'll come back to this after we explore the approaches]*\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 9: The Mega-Prompt Approach\n\n**On Screen:**\n**The Mega-Prompt Approach**\n*\"Put everything in the system prompt\"*\n\n🧱 **Lego:** Comprehensive instruction manual for every build\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parenting:** Detailed rules for every situation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe mega-prompt approach made perfect sense for early LLMs. Like giving a new Lego builder a comprehensive instruction manual, or writing detailed household rules for young children.\n\nWhen LLMs needed explicit guidance for every scenario, packing everything into a massive system prompt - coding standards, architecture principles, deployment processes - was the logical solution.\n\n**When it worked well:** Early LLMs that needed detailed instructions\n**Current considerations:** Can cause information overload with mature LLMs, but still valuable for specific, well-defined scenarios\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 10: The Agent Approach\n\n**On Screen:**\n**The Agent Approach**\n*\"Specialized systems for specialized tasks\"*\n\n🧱 **Lego:** Assembly line with specialized workers\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parenting:** Structured activities with clear roles\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe agent approach emerged as a sophisticated solution - separate systems for different functions. One agent searches files, another analyzes dependencies, a third makes decisions about relevance.\n\nLike an assembly line where each worker has a specific role, or structured family activities where everyone has clear responsibilities.\n\n**When it works well:** Complex workflows, specialized tasks that benefit from dedicated focus\n**Current considerations:** Can limit the natural flexibility of mature LLMs, but valuable for certain enterprise use cases\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 11: The IDE Integration Approach\n\n**On Screen:**\n**The IDE Integration Approach**\n*\"Developer chooses the context\"*\n\n🧱 **Lego:** Expert builder selecting their own pieces\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parenting:** Collaborative decision-making with teenagers\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe IDE integration approach put control in the developer's hands. You select which files, which context, which information to share with the LLM.\n\nLike an expert Lego builder choosing exactly which pieces they need, or collaborative decision-making where you involve your teenager in choosing what information they need.\n\n**When it works well:** Developer-controlled scenarios, focused tasks with clear scope\n**Current challenges:** Creates cognitive load on humans to assess context relevance, but still relevant for targeted work\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 12: The Pattern\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Each Approach Matched Its Time**\n\nEarly LLMs → Detailed Instructions\nCapable LLMs → Structured Workflows  \nMature LLMs → **Context Collaboration**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's the pattern: each approach matched the maturity level of the LLMs available at the time. Early LLMs needed detailed instructions. More capable LLMs could handle structured workflows. \n\nBut now we have mature LLMs that are ready for something different: true context-based collaboration.\n\nThe question isn't which approach was right or wrong - it's recognizing when it's time to evolve to the next level.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 13: The Next Evolution\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Engineering**\n*The natural progression for mature LLMs*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nSo what's the next evolution? Context Engineering. This isn't about replacing the previous approaches - it's about recognizing that mature LLMs are ready for a fundamentally different kind of collaboration.\n\nJust like we adjust our parenting style as children mature, we need to adjust how we work with LLMs as they become more capable.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 14: Tobi Lütke's Insight\n\n**On Screen:**\n*\"I really like the term 'context engineering' over prompt engineering. It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.\"*\n\n**— Tobi Lütke, CEO Shopify**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nTobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, captured this perfectly. Context Engineering isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental shift in perspective.\n\nPrompt Engineering asks: \"How should the LLM work?\"\nContext Engineering asks: \"What information does it need?\"\n\nIt's the difference between being a micromanager and being a good team leader. The micromanager explains every step. The good team leader ensures all relevant information is available and lets the team work.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 15: Context Engineering Defined\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Engineering:**\n*Providing the right information at the right time*\n\n🧱 **Lego:** Right manual, pieces, and examples for THIS build\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parenting:** Appropriate boundaries and context for THIS situation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nContext Engineering is the discipline of providing the right information at the right time. \n\nIn Lego terms: instead of a generic instruction manual, you provide the specific manual, the right pieces, and relevant examples for THIS particular build.\n\nIn parenting terms: instead of universal rules, you provide appropriate boundaries and context for THIS specific situation, trusting their maturity to handle it well.\n\nThe key insight is specificity and trust in the system's capability to work intelligently within the provided context.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 16: The Breakthrough - Phase-Specific Context\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Different Phases Need Different Context**\n\n📋 **Project Start:** Requirements, architecture, similar projects\n🔧 **Implementation:** Relevant code, patterns, APIs  \n🐛 **Debugging:** Error logs, related code, recent changes\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's the breakthrough insight that changed everything for me: relevant context is heavily dependent on the current development phase.\n\nWhen you're starting a project, you need requirements, architecture documentation, and examples of similar projects. Detailed code implementations are irrelevant and just add noise.\n\nWhen you're implementing, you need the relevant code files, established patterns, and API documentation. High-level requirements documents become noise.\n\nWhen you're debugging, you need error logs, the specific code involved, and recent changes. Everything else is distraction.\n\nThis phase-awareness is what makes Context Engineering so powerful - it's not just about having information, it's about having the RIGHT information for what you're trying to accomplish right now.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 17: Context Relevance Matrix\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Relevance by Phase**\n\n| Information Type | Project Start | Implementation | Debugging |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Requirements     | ✅ Critical   | ❌ Noise      | ❌ Noise  |\n| Code Files       | ❌ Noise      | ✅ Critical   | ✅ Critical |\n| Error Logs       | ❌ Noise      | ❌ Noise      | ✅ Critical |\n| Architecture     | ✅ Critical   | ⚠️ Sometimes  | ❌ Noise  |\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis matrix illustrates the core principle. The same piece of information can be critical in one phase and pure noise in another.\n\nRequirements are critical when starting a project but become noise when you're deep in debugging. Error logs are essential for debugging but irrelevant when you're planning architecture.\n\nTraditional approaches either try to provide everything (information overload) or make humans decide what's relevant (cognitive overload). Context Engineering provides the right information for the current phase.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 18: Post-Agentistic Vision\n\n**On Screen:**\n**LLMs as Flexible Orchestrators**\n*Not rigid agents, but intelligent collaborators*\n\n**The Future:** LLMs choose their own tools and context\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis leads us to what I call a post-agentistic vision. Instead of rigid agent pipelines that constrain LLM flexibility, we let mature LLMs orchestrate their own tool usage.\n\nThink about it: LLMs are getting better at using tools flexibly through standards like the Model Context Protocol. Why force them into rigid agent workflows when they can intelligently choose what they need?\n\nIt's like the difference between a strict assembly line and a skilled craftsperson who selects the right tools for each task. The craftsperson approach leverages the full capability of the mature system.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 19: Practical Implementation\n\n**On Screen:**\n**How Context Engineering Works in Practice**\n\n1. **Phase Recognition:** System understands current development phase\n2. **Context Selection:** Provides relevant information for that phase  \n3. **Flexible Orchestration:** LLM chooses appropriate tools and approaches\n4. **Natural Memory:** Context builds understanding over time\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nIn practice, Context Engineering works through four key elements:\n\nFirst, the system recognizes what phase of development you're in - are you exploring, designing, implementing, or debugging?\n\nSecond, it provides the context that's relevant for that specific phase, filtering out the noise.\n\nThird, it lets the LLM orchestrate flexibly - choosing the right tools and approaches for the task at hand.\n\nFourth, it builds natural memory over time, so context accumulates and understanding deepens throughout the project.\n\nThis isn't about replacing human judgment - it's about augmenting it with intelligent context management.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 20: Context Engineering is Engineering\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Engineering is Engineering**\n*Different skills, same importance*\n\n**Traditional Engineering:** Building systems that work\n**Context Engineering:** Providing information that enables intelligence\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's the crucial point: Context Engineering is engineering. It's not a soft skill or a nice-to-have. It's a core engineering discipline that requires the same rigor and expertise as any other engineering practice.\n\nTraditional engineering is about building systems that work reliably and efficiently. Context Engineering is about providing information that enables intelligent systems to work effectively.\n\nBoth require deep understanding, systematic thinking, and continuous refinement. Both are essential for success in their respective domains.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 21: The Skills Shift\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Engineers Must Evolve to Remain Relevant**\n\n**New Core Skills:**\n- Information architecture for AI systems\n- Phase-aware context design  \n- Intelligent tool orchestration\n- Context quality assessment\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe message is clear: engineers must develop these new skills to remain relevant in the AI era. This isn't about replacing coding skills - it's about adding a new dimension to our expertise.\n\nWe need to become skilled at information architecture for AI systems, designing context that's aware of development phases, orchestrating intelligent tool usage, and assessing the quality of the context we provide.\n\nThese skills are as learnable and measurable as any other engineering discipline. The question is: will you develop them proactively, or will you be forced to catch up later?\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 22: The Opportunity\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Those Who Master Context Engineering Will Thrive**\n\n**The Advantage:**\n- More effective AI collaboration\n- Better project outcomes  \n- Reduced cognitive load\n- Competitive differentiation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe opportunity for those who master Context Engineering is enormous. You'll collaborate more effectively with AI systems, achieve better project outcomes, reduce your own cognitive load, and create significant competitive differentiation.\n\nWhile others are still micromanaging AI tools or struggling with information overload, you'll be working in true partnership with mature AI systems.\n\nThis isn't just about being more productive - it's about fundamentally changing how software gets built and how problems get solved.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 23: Your Next Steps\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Start Your Context Engineering Journey**\n\n1. **Assess** your current context supply methods\n2. **Experiment** with phase-aware context\n3. **Build** tools that support context engineering\n4. **Share** your learnings with the community\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nSo where do you start? First, honestly assess how you currently supply context to AI systems. Are you using mega-prompts? Agent workflows? Manual selection? Each has its place, but recognize the limitations.\n\nSecond, experiment with phase-aware context. Try providing different information based on what you're trying to accomplish. Notice the difference in AI responses.\n\nThird, consider building or adopting tools that support context engineering principles. This might be as simple as better organization of your development context, or as sophisticated as systems that automatically provide phase-relevant information.\n\nFinally, share your learnings. Context Engineering is still emerging as a discipline. Your experiments and insights contribute to the collective understanding.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 24: Final Thought\n\n**On Screen:**\n**\"The future belongs not to those who prompt best, but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively\"**\n\n**Context is all you need.**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nI'll leave you with this thought: The future belongs not to those who craft the cleverest prompts, but to those who understand how to provide what LLMs need to work effectively.\n\nJust like \"Attention is all you need\" unlocked the potential of Transformers, \"Context is all you need\" unlocks the potential of mature AI collaboration.\n\nThe tools are ready. The LLMs are mature. The question is: are you ready to engineer the context that will define the next era of software development?\n\nThank you. I'm happy to take your questions.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 25: Q&A\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Questions & Discussion**\n\n*Individual developer strengths and Context Engineering adaptations*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n[This is where you can discuss how Context Engineering tools should adapt to individual developer strengths - the topic we saved for Q&A]\n\n---\n\n## Presentation Summary\n\n**Total Duration:** 30 minutes\n**Target Audience:** Developers, development managers, AI/software development enthusiasts\n**Setting:** Conference talk format\n**Key Message:** Context Engineering is the essential skill for AI-era developers\n\n**Structure:**\n- Opening Hook (3 min): Personal story with Lego/parenting metaphors\n- Evolution (5 min): Technical foundation and maturity concept  \n- Approaches (10 min): Three evolutionary approaches to LLM context\n- Solution (10 min): Context Engineering as the next evolution\n- Call to Action (2 min): Skills development and next steps\n\n**Visual Requirements:**\n- Lego building progression illustrations\n- Parenting scenario comparisons\n- Context relevance matrix\n- Phase-specific context examples\n- Tobi Lütke quote highlight",

I'm here to talk about what I believe is the most important skill shift happening in software development right now.

You carefully place each piece, following your mental blueprint, building something complex from simple components.\n\nBut recently, I had to update that explanation. Now I tell her: \"I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot.\" The transformation has been that dramatic.\n\n**[Audience Engagement]** How many of you have tried to explain your job to your kids? *[Show of hands, brief interaction]*\n\nBut here's the thing...\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 3: The Question\n\n**On Screen:**\n**How can LLMs be so good at guessing?**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis raises a fundamental question that I keep coming back to: How can these LLMs be so incredibly good at guessing what we want?\n\nThe answer isn't magic. It follows a pattern we recognize from human development...\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 4: The Maturity Formula\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Technical Skills + Experience = Maturity**\n\n**Maturity + Available Knowledge = Good Guessing**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThink about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call \"good guessing.\"\n\nThe same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity.

The craftsperson approach leverages the full capability of the mature system.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 19: Practical Implementation\n\n**On Screen:**\n**How Context Engineering Works in Practice**\n\n1. **Phase Recognition:** System understands current development phase\n2. **Context Selection:** Provides relevant information for that phase  \n3. **Flexible Orchestration:** LLM chooses appropriate tools and approaches\n4. **Natural Memory:** Context builds understanding over time\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nIn practice, Context Engineering works through four key elements:\n\nFirst, the system recognizes what phase of development you're in - are you exploring, designing, implementing, or debugging?\n\nSecond, it provides the context that's relevant for that specific phase, filtering out the noise.\n\nThird, it lets the LLM orchestrate flexibly - choosing the right tools and approaches for the task at hand.\n\nFourth, it builds natural memory over time, so context accumulates and understanding deepens throughout the project.\n\nThis isn't about replacing human judgment - it's about augmenting it with intelligent context management.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 20: Context Engineering is Engineering\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Engineering is Engineering**\n*Different skills, same importance*\n\n**Traditional Engineering:** Building systems that work\n**Context Engineering:** Providing information that enables intelligence\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's the crucial point: Context Engineering is engineering. It's not a soft skill or a nice-to-have. It's a core engineering discipline that requires the same rigor and expertise as any other engineering practice.\n\nTraditional engineering is about building systems that work reliably and efficiently. Context Engineering is about providing information that enables intelligent systems to work effectively.\n\nBoth require deep understanding, systematic thinking, and continuous refinement. Both are essential for success in their respective domains.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 21: The Skills Shift\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Engineers Must Evolve to Remain Relevant**\n\n**New Core Skills:**\n- Information architecture for AI systems\n- Phase-aware context design  \n- Intelligent tool orchestration\n- Context quality assessment\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe message is clear: engineers must develop these new skills to remain relevant in the AI era. This isn't about replacing coding skills - it's about adding a new dimension to our expertise.\n\nWe need to become skilled at information architecture for AI systems, designing context that's aware of development phases, orchestrating intelligent tool usage, and assessing the quality of the context we provide.\n\nThese skills are as learnable and measurable as any other engineering discipline. The question is: will you develop them proactively, or will you be forced to catch up later?\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 22: The Opportunity\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Those Who Master Context Engineering Will Thrive**\n\n**The Advantage:**\n- More effective AI collaboration\n- Better project outcomes  \n- Reduced cognitive load\n- Competitive differentiation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe opportunity for those who master Context Engineering is enormous. You'll collaborate more effectively with AI systems, achieve better project outcomes, reduce your own cognitive load, and create significant competitive differentiation.\n\nWhile others are still micromanaging AI tools or struggling with information overload, you'll be working in true partnership with mature AI systems.\n\nThis isn't just about being more productive - it's about fundamentally changing how software gets built and how problems get solved.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 23: Your Next Steps\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Start Your Context Engineering Journey**\n\n1. **Assess** your current context supply methods\n2. **Experiment** with phase-aware context\n3. **Build** tools that support context engineering\n4. **Share** your learnings with the community\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nSo where do you start? First, honestly assess how you currently supply context to AI systems. Are you using mega-prompts? Agent workflows? Manual selection? Each has its place, but recognize the limitations.\n\nSecond, experiment with phase-aware context. Try providing different information based on what you're trying to accomplish. Notice the difference in AI responses.\n\nThird, consider building or adopting tools that support context engineering principles. This might be as simple as better organization of your development context, or as sophisticated as systems that automatically provide phase-relevant information.\n\nFinally, share your learnings. Context Engineering is still emerging as a discipline. Your experiments and insights contribute to the collective understanding.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 24: Final Thought\n\n**On Screen:**\n**\"The future belongs not to those who prompt best, but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively\"**\n\n**Context is all you need.**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nI'll leave you with this thought: The future belongs not to those who craft the cleverest prompts, but to those who understand how to provide what LLMs need to work effectively.\n\nJust like \"Attention is all you need\" unlocked the potential of Transformers, \"Context is all you need\" unlocks the potential of mature AI collaboration.\n\nThe tools are ready. The LLMs are mature. The question is: are you ready to engineer the context that will define the next era of software development?\n\nThank you. I'm happy to take your questions.\n\n---\n\n## SLIDE 25: Q&A\n\n**On Screen:**\n**Questions & Discussion**\n\n*Individual developer strengths and Context Engineering adaptations*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n[This is where you can discuss how Context Engineering tools should adapt to individual developer strengths - the topic we saved for Q&A]\n\n---\n\n## Presentation Summary\n\n**Total Duration:** 30 minutes\n**Target Audience:** Developers, development managers, AI/software development enthusiasts\n**Setting:** Conference talk format\n**Key Message:** Context Engineering is the essential skill for AI-era developers\n\n**Structure:**\n- Opening Hook (3 min): Personal story with Lego/parenting metaphors\n- Evolution (5 min): Technical foundation and maturity concept  \n- Approaches (10 min): Three evolutionary approaches to LLM context\n- Solution (10 min): Context Engineering as the next evolution\n- Call to Action (2 min): Skills development and next steps\n\n**Visual Requirements:**\n- Lego building progression illustrations\n- Parenting scenario comparisons\n- Context relevance matrix\n- Phase-specific context examples\n- Tobi Lütke quote highlight",

Let me work on the visual design and presentation format decisions.\n\n## 🎨 **Style Phase: Visual Design & Presentation Format**\n\n### **Platform Recommendation: Slidev**\n\nGiven that you're in a Slidev project directory and it's perfect for developer presentations, I recommend using **Slidev** for this presentation. Here's why:\n\n**Advantages for your talk:**\n- **Developer-friendly**: Markdown-based, version controlled\n- **Code-friendly**: Great syntax highlighting (though we're not using much code)\n- **Flexible layouts**: Perfect for your dual metaphor approach\n- **Professional themes**: Clean, conference-appropriate designs\n- **Easy deployment**: Can export to PDF, host online, or present directly\n\n### **Visual Design Approach**\n\n**Theme Recommendation: `@slidev/theme-default` or `@slidev/theme-seriph`**\n- Clean, professional appearance\n- Good typography for conference settings\n- Flexible layout options for your content mix\n\n**Color Scheme:**\n- **Primary**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - represents trust, intelligence\n- **Accent**: Warm orange (#f59e0b) - represents creativity, energy\n- **Supporting**: Light grays for backgrounds, dark gray for text\n\n### **Key Visual Elements to Create:**\n\n**1. Lego Building Progression (Slides 2, 9-11, 15)**\n- Simple icons showing: Manual building → Robot with instructions → Robot with context\n- Clean, minimalist style\n- Consistent color scheme\n\n**2. Parenting Scenarios (Slides 9-11, 15)**\n- Simple family icons showing different interaction styles\n- Micromanaging → Structured → Collaborative approaches\n\n**3. Technical Architecture (Slide 6)**\n- Clean diagram: Transformers → Attention → Context\n- Flow arrows, simple boxes\n- Not too technical, conference-friendly\n\n**4. Context Relevance Matrix (Slide 17)**\n- Clean table with color coding\n- Green (✅) for critical, Red (❌) for noise, Yellow (⚠️) for sometimes\n- Easy to read from distance\n\n**5. Phase Flow Diagram (Slide 16)**\n- Timeline or flow showing different development phases\n- Icons for each phase: 📋 🔧 🐛\n- Context bubbles for each phase\n\nWould you like me to create the actual Slidev presentation file with these design specifications, or would you prefer to discuss the visual approach further first?"

Target Audience & Context:**\n- Who will be watching this presentation? (Developers, tech leads, conference audience, internal team?)\n- What's their current knowledge level with AI/LLM tools?\n- What's the setting? (Conference talk, team meeting, workshop?)\n\n**2. Presentation Goals:**\n- Primary goal: Educate about Context Engineering concept?\n- Secondary goals: Promote your MCP solution? Change how people think about AI tooling?\n- What should the audience do differently after your talk?\n\n**3. Format & Constraints:**\n- How long is your presentation slot?\n- Will there be Q&A time?\n- Any specific requirements or constraints?\n\n**4. Key Messages Priority:**\n- Which concepts are absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?\n- Should we focus more on the problem analysis or your solution?\n\nLet me know your thoughts on these questions, and I'll help shape the presentation concept accordingly!\n[Tool uses: none]",

    "Great refinements! Now let's explore metaphors - this is crucial for making Context Engineering tangible for your audience.\n\n## 🧱 **The Lego Metaphor - Extended**\n\n**Programming as Lego Building:**\n- Traditional coding: You manually place each brick, following instructions\n- AI-assisted: You describe the castle to a Lego robot, it builds it\n- **But here's the key**: The robot needs to see the instruction manual, know what pieces are available, understand the building context\n\n**Context Engineering as Lego Mastery:**\n- **Prompt Engineering**: Telling the robot HOW to build (\"Place red brick on blue brick, then...\")\n- **Context Engineering**: Giving the robot the RIGHT INFORMATION to build well (instruction manual, piece inventory, similar builds, building constraints)\n\n**Visual potential**: Could show evolution from manual building → instructing robot → providing context to robot\n\n## 🎭 **Alternative Metaphors to Consider**\n\n**1. The Orchestra Conductor**\n- **Traditional coding**: You play every instrument yourself\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You give detailed instructions to each musician\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide the sheet music, set the mood, give musicians the context they need to perform beautifully\n- *Strength*: Emphasizes orchestration and harmony\n\n**2. The Master Chef / Sous Chef**\n- **Traditional coding**: You cook everything yourself\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You give step-by-step cooking instructions\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide the recipe, ingredients, kitchen setup, and culinary context\n- *Strength*: Familiar to everyone, emphasizes preparation and context\n\n**3. The GPS Navigation**\n- **Traditional coding**: You memorize every street and navigate manually\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You give turn-by-turn directions\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide the map, traffic conditions, destination context, and let the system find the best route\n- *Strength*: Everyone uses GPS, emphasizes intelligent routing\n\n**4. The Personal Assistant**\n- **Traditional coding**: You do all tasks yourself\n- **Prompt Engineering**: You micromanage every task step-by-step\n- **Context Engineering**: You provide context about your preferences, schedule, priorities, and let them work intelligently\n- *Strength*: Relatable, emphasizes trust and autonomy\n\n## 🤔 **Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Which metaphor resonates most with you?** The Lego one has personal connection from your blog, but others might be more universally relatable.\n\n2. **Consistency throughout**: Should we stick to one metaphor throughout the entire presentation, or use different ones for different concepts?\n\n3. **Visual execution**: Which metaphor would work best visually on slides? (Lego has great visual potential, but so does the conductor/orchestra)\n\n4. **Audience connection**: Which metaphor do you think will click best with developers and dev managers?\n\nThe metaphor choice will significantly influence how we structure the presentation and create visuals.

    "Brilliant idea! The dual metaphor approach perfectly addresses your mixed audience. Let me work this out:\n\n## 🎯 **Dual Metaphor Strategy**\n\n**Opening Setup** (Your personal story):\n- \"I used to tell my daughter programming is like professional Lego building...\"\n- \"Now I tell her it's like having a really smart assistant who can also build with Lego\"\n\n## 🧱 **Lego Metaphor (For Developers)**\n\n**Traditional Coding**: You place every brick manually\n**Prompt Engineering**: \"Place red brick here, blue brick there, now connect them...\"\n**Context Engineering**: Give the builder the instruction manual, show similar builds, provide the right pieces\n\n## 👔 **Personal Assistant Metaphor (For Managers)**\n\n**Traditional Management**: You do every task yourself\n**Prompt Engineering**: Micromanaging every step (\"First call John, then email Sarah, then...\")\n**Context Engineering**: Provide context about priorities, relationships, goals - let them work intelligently\n\n## 🎭 **How to Use Both Briefly**\n\n**Slide Structure Idea**:\n1. **Opening**: Your daughter story (introduces both)\n2. **Problem Definition**: Use both metaphors side by side\n   - \"Whether you're building with Lego or managing with assistants...\"\n3. **Solutions Comparison**: Show both perspectives\n   - Lego builder getting wrong instructions vs. right context\n   - Assistant getting micromanaged vs. empowered with context\n\n**Visual Potential**:\n- Split-screen slides showing both metaphors\n- Same concept, two perspectives\n- Reinforces the message for both audience segments\n\n## 🤔 **Quick Check**:\n\nDoes this approach feel right? The beauty is:\n- **Developers** connect with the technical Lego building\n- **Managers** relate to the assistant delegation\n- **Both** understand the core message: Context > Instructions\n\nShould we proceed with this dual approach, or would you like to refine it further?\n[Tool uses: none]",

The 2017 paper \"Attention is all you need\" wasn't just a catchy title - it was a fundamental insight.\n\nThe ability to direct attention means the ability to focus on relevant context. And when you can focus on the right context at the right time, you can make much better decisions.\n\nThis isn't just about LLMs getting bigger or having more parameters. It's about a fundamental capability that enables context-aware processing. The architecture that makes good guessing possible.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 7: The Current State**\n**On Screen:**\n**The Problem:**\n*We're still treating mature LLMs like toddlers*\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n*They're ready for context-based collaboration*\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's where we are today: LLMs have reached this level of maturity, but most of us are still interacting with them as if they were toddlers who need every step explained.\n\nIt's like continuing to micromanage a teenager who's perfectly capable of handling responsibility when given the right context and boundaries.\n\nThe opportunity is enormous.

This isn't about replacing the previous approaches - it's about recognizing that mature LLMs are ready for a fundamentally different kind of collaboration.\n\nJust like we adjust our parenting style as children mature, we need to adjust how we work with LLMs as they become more capable.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 14: Tobi Lütke's Insight**\n**On Screen:**\n*\"I really like the term 'context engineering' over prompt engineering. It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.\"*\n\n**— Tobi Lütke, CEO Shopify**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nTobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, captured this perfectly. Context Engineering isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental shift in perspective.\n\nPrompt Engineering asks: \"How should the LLM work?\"\nContext Engineering asks: \"What information does it need?\"\n\nIt's the difference between being a micromanager and being a good team leader. The micromanager explains every step. The good team leader ensures all relevant information is available and lets the team work.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 15: Context Engineering Defined**\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Engineering:**\n*Providing the right information at the right time*\n\n🧱 **Lego:** Right manual, pieces, and examples for THIS build\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parenting:** Appropriate boundaries and context for THIS situation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nContext Engineering is the discipline of providing the right information at the right time. \n\nIn Lego terms: instead of a generic instruction manual, you provide the specific manual, the right pieces, and relevant examples for THIS particular build.\n\nIn parenting terms: instead of universal rules, you provide appropriate boundaries and context for THIS specific situation, trusting their maturity to handle it well.\n\nThe key insight is specificity and trust in the system's capability to work intelligently within the provided context.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 16: The Breakthrough - Phase-Specific Context**\n**On Screen:**\n**Different Phases Need Different Context**\n\n📋 **Project Start:** Requirements, architecture, similar projects\n🔧 **Implementation:** Relevant code, patterns, APIs  \n🐛 **Debugging:** Error logs, related code, recent changes\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nHere's the breakthrough insight that changed everything for me: relevant context is heavily dependent on the current development phase.\n\nWhen you're starting a project, you need requirements, architecture documentation, and examples of similar projects. Detailed code implementations are irrelevant and just add noise.\n\nWhen you're implementing, you need the relevant code files, established patterns, and API documentation. High-level requirements documents become noise.\n\nWhen you're debugging, you need error logs, the specific code involved, and recent changes. Everything else is distraction.\n\nThis phase-awareness is what makes Context Engineering so powerful - it's not just about having information, it's about having the RIGHT information for what you're trying to accomplish right now.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 17: Context Relevance Matrix**\n**On Screen:**\n**Context Relevance by Phase**\n\n| Information Type | Project Start | Implementation | Debugging |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Requirements     | ✅ Critical   | ❌ Noise      | ❌ Noise  |\n| Code Files       | ❌ Noise      | ✅ Critical   | ✅ Critical |\n| Error Logs       | ❌ Noise      | ❌ Noise      | ✅ Critical |\n| Architecture     | ✅ Critical   | ⚠️ Sometimes  | ❌ Noise  |\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis matrix illustrates the core principle. The same piece of information can be critical in one phase and pure noise in another.\n\nRequirements are critical when starting a project but become noise when you're deep in debugging. Error logs are essential for debugging but irrelevant when you're planning architecture.\n\nTraditional approaches either try to provide everything (information overload) or make humans decide what's relevant (cognitive overload). Context Engineering provides the right information for the current phase.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 18: Post-Agentistic Vision**\n**On Screen:**\n**LLMs as Flexible Orchestrators**\n*Not rigid agents, but intelligent collaborators*\n\n**The Future:** LLMs choose their own tools and context\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThis leads us to what I call a post-agentistic vision. Instead of rigid agent pipelines that constrain LLM flexibility, we let mature LLMs orchestrate their own tool usage.\n\nThink about it: LLMs are getting better at using tools flexibly through standards like the Model Context Protocol. Why force them into rigid agent workflows when they can intelligently choose what they need?\n\nIt's like the difference between a strict assembly line and a skilled craftsperson who selects the right tools for each task. The craftsperson approach leverages the full capability of the mature system.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 19: Practical Implementation**\n**On Screen:**\n**How Context Engineering Works in Practice**\n\n1. **Phase Recognition:** System understands current development phase\n2. **Context Selection:** Provides relevant information for that phase  \n3. **Flexible Orchestration:** LLM chooses appropriate tools and approaches\n4. **Natural Memory:** Context builds understanding over time\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nIn practice, Context Engineering works through four key elements:\n\nFirst, the system recognizes what phase of development you're in - are you exploring, designing, implementing, or debugging?\n\nSecond, it provides the context that's relevant for that specific phase, filtering out the noise.\n\nThird, it lets the LLM orchestrate flexibly - choosing the right tools and approaches for the task at hand.\n\nFourth, it builds natural memory over time, so context accumulates and understanding deepens throughout the project.\n\nThis isn't about replacing human judgment - it's about augmenting it with intelligent context management.\n\nShould I continue with the final call-to-action section?\n[Tool uses: none]",

It's not a soft skill or a nice-to-have. It's a core engineering discipline that requires the same rigor and expertise as any other engineering practice.\n\nTraditional engineering is about building systems that work reliably and efficiently. Context Engineering is about providing information that enables intelligent systems to work effectively.\n\nBoth require deep understanding, systematic thinking, and continuous refinement. Both are essential for success in their respective domains.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 21: The Skills Shift**\n**On Screen:**\n**Engineers Must Evolve to Remain Relevant**\n\n**New Core Skills:**\n- Information architecture for AI systems\n- Phase-aware context design  \n- Intelligent tool orchestration\n- Context quality assessment\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe message is clear: engineers must develop these new skills to remain relevant in the AI era. This isn't about replacing coding skills - it's about adding a new dimension to our expertise.\n\nWe need to become skilled at information architecture for AI systems, designing context that's aware of development phases, orchestrating intelligent tool usage, and assessing the quality of the context we provide.\n\nThese skills are as learnable and measurable as any other engineering discipline. The question is: will you develop them proactively, or will you be forced to catch up later?\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 22: The Opportunity**\n**On Screen:**\n**Those Who Master Context Engineering Will Thrive**\n\n**The Advantage:**\n- More effective AI collaboration\n- Better project outcomes  \n- Reduced cognitive load\n- Competitive differentiation\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nThe opportunity for those who master Context Engineering is enormous. You'll collaborate more effectively with AI systems, achieve better project outcomes, reduce your own cognitive load, and create significant competitive differentiation.\n\nWhile others are still micromanaging AI tools or struggling with information overload, you'll be working in true partnership with mature AI systems.\n\nThis isn't just about being more productive - it's about fundamentally changing how software gets built and how problems get solved.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 23: Your Next Steps**\n**On Screen:**\n**Start Your Context Engineering Journey**\n\n1. **Assess** your current context supply methods\n2. **Experiment** with phase-aware context\n3. **Build** tools that support context engineering\n4. **Share** your learnings with the community\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nSo where do you start? First, honestly assess how you currently supply context to AI systems. Are you using mega-prompts? Agent workflows? Manual selection? Each has its place, but recognize the limitations.\n\nSecond, experiment with phase-aware context. Try providing different information based on what you're trying to accomplish. Notice the difference in AI responses.\n\nThird, consider building or adopting tools that support context engineering principles. This might be as simple as better organization of your development context, or as sophisticated as systems that automatically provide phase-relevant information.\n\nFinally, share your learnings. Context Engineering is still emerging as a discipline. Your experiments and insights contribute to the collective understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 24: Final Thought**\n**On Screen:**\n**\"The future belongs not to those who prompt best, but to those who provide what LLMs need to work effectively\"**\n\n**Context is all you need.**\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\nI'll leave you with this thought: The future belongs not to those who craft the cleverest prompts, but to those who understand how to provide what LLMs need to work effectively.\n\nJust like \"Attention is all you need\" unlocked the potential of Transformers, \"Context is all you need\" unlocks the potential of mature AI collaboration.\n\nThe tools are ready.

Here's why:\n\n**Advantages for your talk:**\n- **Developer-friendly**: Markdown-based, version controlled\n- **Code-friendly**: Great syntax highlighting (though we're not using much code)\n- **Flexible layouts**: Perfect for your dual metaphor approach\n- **Professional themes**: Clean, conference-appropriate designs\n- **Easy deployment**: Can export to PDF, host online, or present directly\n\n### **Visual Design Approach**\n\n**Theme Recommendation: `@slidev/theme-default` or `@slidev/theme-seriph`**\n- Clean, professional appearance\n- Good typography for conference settings\n- Flexible layout options for your content mix\n\n**Color Scheme:**\n- **Primary**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - represents trust, intelligence\n- **Accent**: Warm orange (#f59e0b) - represents creativity, energy\n- **Supporting**: Light grays for backgrounds, dark gray for text\n\n### **Key Visual Elements to Create:**\n\n**1. Lego Building Progression (Slides 2, 9-11, 15)**\n- Simple icons showing: Manual building → Robot with instructions → Robot with context\n- Clean, minimalist style\n- Consistent color scheme\n\n**2. Parenting Scenarios (Slides 9-11, 15)**\n- Simple family icons showing different interaction styles\n- Micromanaging → Structured → Collaborative approaches\n\n**3. Technical Architecture (Slide 6)**\n- Clean diagram: Transformers → Attention → Context\n- Flow arrows, simple boxes\n- Not too technical, conference-friendly\n\n**4. Context Relevance Matrix (Slide 17)**\n- Clean table with color coding\n- Green (✅) for critical, Red (❌) for noise, Yellow (⚠️) for sometimes\n- Easy to read from distance\n\n**5. Phase Flow Diagram (Slide 16)**\n- Timeline or flow showing different development phases\n- Icons for each phase: 📋 🔧 🐛\n- Context bubbles for each phase\n\nWould you like me to create the actual Slidev presentation file with these design specifications, or would you prefer to discuss the visual approach further first?\n[Tool uses: none]",

The file must exist.\n Notes for using the `str_replace` command:\n * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`.",

The available modes are:\n- line: Show lines in a file, given by an optional `start_line` and optional `end_line`.\n- directory: List directory contents. Content is returned in the \"long format\" of ls (that is, `ls -la`).\n- search: Search for a pattern in a file. The pattern is a string. The matching is case insensitive.\n\nExample Usage:\n1. Read all lines from a file: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\"\n2. Read the last 5 lines from a file: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\", start_line=-5\n3. List the files in the home directory: command=\"line\", path=\"~\"\n4. Recursively list files in a directory to a max depth of 2: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/directory\", depth=2\n5.
