# Each Approach Matched Its Time

<div class="text-center space-y-8">

<div class="text-xl">
<div class="i-uim-baby inline text-blue-400 mr-2"></div> Early LLMs → <div class="i-uim-file-text inline text-orange-500 mr-2"></div> Detailed Instructions
</div>

<div class="text-xl">
<div class="i-uim-child inline text-green-400 mr-2"></div> Capable LLMs → <div class="i-uim-sitemap inline text-purple-500 mr-2"></div> Structured Workflows
</div>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold">
<div class="i-uim-user inline text-blue-600 mr-2"></div> Mature LLMs → <div class="i-uim-database inline text-red-500 mr-2"></div> **Context Collaboration**
</div>

</div>

<!--
Here's the pattern: each approach matched the maturity level of the LLMs available at the time. Early LLMs needed detailed instructions. More capable LLMs could handle structured workflows. 

But now we have mature LLMs that are ready for something different: true context-based collaboration.

The question isn't which approach was right or wrong - it's recognizing when it's time to evolve to the next level.
