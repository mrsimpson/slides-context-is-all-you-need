# The Maturity Formula

<!--
**Technical Skills** + **Experience** = **Maturity**

**Maturity** + **Available Knowledge** = **Good Guessing**

While modern tech allowed to compensate for lack of experience, making historic knowledge available at everybody's fingertips


Think about how this works with humans first. Technical skills combined with experience creates maturity. Then, when you give that mature person the right available knowledge, they make good decisions - what we might call "good guessing."

The same pattern applies to LLMs. They've developed technical capabilities, gained experience through training, and reached a level of maturity. Now, when we provide them with the right available knowledge - the right context - they can make remarkably good decisions.

This isn't magic. It's a predictable pattern of development that we can understand and work with.
