So where do you start? First, honestly assess how you currently supply context to AI systems. Are you using mega-prompts? Agent workflows? Manual selection? Each has its place, but recognize the limitations.

Second, experiment with phase-aware context. Try providing different information based on what you're trying to accomplish. Notice the difference in AI responses.

Third, consider building or adopting tools that support context engineering principles. This might be as simple as better organization of your development context, or as sophisticated as systems that automatically provide phase-relevant information.

Finally, share your learnings. Context Engineering is still emerging as a discipline. Your experiments and insights contribute to the collective understanding.
